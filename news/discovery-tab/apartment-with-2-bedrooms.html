                    <p class="text">As you begin shopping for a new apartment, evaluating the quality of the building you are considering should be top priority.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are some tips to help you evaluate the quality of an apartment building:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Visit the building during the day and night: Stop by during the day and at night when the building is in use and take a good look at the grounds. Are there any signs of disrepair? Do the people living in the building appear to be content?</li>
                            <li class="text">Speak to the residents: Speak to residents of the building and ask them questions about noise levels, plumbing issues, heating/air conditioning issues, and other problems they may have experienced. They can be great sources of information.</li>
                            <li class="text">Investigate the neighborhood: Look up crime rates in the neighborhood and see whether or not the building appears to be safe.</li>
                            <li class="text">Check the building codes: Research the building codes and safety regulations and make sure that the building management is compliant with them.</li>
                            <li class="text">Evaluate the amenities: If a building has a gym, pool, or other features, make sure that they are in order and well maintained.</li>
                            <li class="text">Check the maintenance record: Find out how long the building has been managed by the same company and look up customer reviews. See if they have had consistent maintenance issues or if they have been well managed over the years.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">Following these steps will help you make an informed decision about the quality of the building and ensure that you purchase the right apartment for you.</p>
