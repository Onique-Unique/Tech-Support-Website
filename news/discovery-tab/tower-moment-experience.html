                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-2">The different types of tower moments and how they impact people's lives:</h2>
                    <p class="text">Tower moments are those moments that stick with us, moments that stay with us, and moments that shape us.</p>
                    <p class="text">They can range from funny encounters to profound experiences, but all of them can shape how we view the world around us.</p>
                    <p class="text">These moments can be divided into three broad categories: transformational moments, joyous moments, and meaningful moments:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Transformational moments are ones that take us out of our comfort zone and teach us something entirely new. They can take us to different places, be captured through certain activities, and make us grow as people. These moments can be pivotal in helping us discover our passions and purpose in life.</li>
                            <li class="text">Joyous moments are those that bring us immense levels of joy and happiness. For example, a beautiful sunset on the beach, or a successful event attended with close friends. These are the moments that bring us physical and emotional elation and energy.</li>
                            <li class="text">Finally, meaningful moments are moments that give us a deeper sense of understanding and value. These moments can have a profound impact on our lives and be catalysts for change. Moments like getting married, spending time with a grandparent, or helping a stranger can help us gain a deeper appreciation of life.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">Tower moments can have a huge impact on our lives–they can be both inspiring and eye-opening. Each moment can offer a different perspective, making a lasting impression and helping us define our outlook on life.</p>

                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Acknowledge and reflect on your feelings: When working through a challenging tower moment, it is important to recognize and identify the feelings beneath it. Acknowledge those feelings, either through journaling or talking it out with a trusted friend or mentor, to gain a better understanding of what is driving the current emotions.</li>
                            <li class="text">Take care of yourself: During these moments, it is easy to neglect your personal wellbeing. Continue to take care of yourself and make sure you are doing things that bring you joy and relaxation like exercising, spending time in nature, and engaging in activities that bring you peace.</li>
                            <li class="text">Practice gratitude: Spend time each day finding things to be grateful for, like an extra hour of sleep, or a hot cup of coffee. This simple practice can help you focus on the moments of happiness and remind you that all moments won't last forever.</li>
                            <li class="text">Celebrate the little victories: Take time to celebrate the ‘wins’ each day, no matter how small. Celebrating the little victories can help boost your confidence and remind you that even with challenges, there is still progress being made.</li>
                            <li class="text">Seek support: Don't be afraid to reach out for help if you are feeling overwhelmed. Talking to a friend or confidant can help lift your spirits and create a sense of companionship during these moments. Don't be afraid to ask for help and find the support you need.</li>
