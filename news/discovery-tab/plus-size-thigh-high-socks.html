                    <p class="text">Nothing is more important than finding the perfect fit when it comes to thigh high socks!</p>
                    <p class="text">Whether you’re looking for a fun plus size fashion statement, or just need a little extra warmth, finding the right size can make all the difference.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are a few tips to make sure you get the right fit!</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Start by measuring the circumference of your thigh at its widest point. Start with a fabric measuring tape, make sure it is level around your leg, and don’t pull it too tight. Once you have your measurement, look it up on the size chart that is usually located on the thigh high sock item page to find the perfect size for you.</li>
                            <li class="text">In addition to the thigh circumference, make sure to double-check the length before making your purchase. To do this, measure from the middle of your knee down to the top of your thigh. All thigh high sock brand sizes will accommodate heights ranging from 16 inches to 28 inches.</li>
                            <li class="text">Finally, make sure to also take into account the thickness of the fabric. For example, if you plan on wearing tall boots with your thigh high socks, you’ll want to double-check the thickness of the socks to make sure they won’t add too much bulk to your outfit.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p class="text">Now you’ll be able to rock your thigh high socks with confidence!</p>
