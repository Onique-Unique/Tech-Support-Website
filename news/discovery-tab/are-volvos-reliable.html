From the introduction of the three-point seatbelt in 1959 to the most advanced active safety systems found in the latest Volvo models, Volvo has consistently pushed the boundaries of car safety and brings a wealth of experience to the market.</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <p class="text"> Volvo has an industry leading set of standard safety features, meaning all Volvos come with features like its advanced City Safety system.</p>
                        <p class="text"> This system is designed to detect pedestrians, cyclists and large animals from up to 31 mph and if necessary, take corrective action to automatically brake or steer the car away from them.</p>
                        <p class="text text-alt"> In addition to this system being standard, Volvo offers optional safety packs, like Blind Spot Information System.</p>
                        <p class="text"> This uses multiple cameras and sensors across the vehicle to detect if another vehicle is in your blind spot and alert you to their presence.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="text">For both city and open-road driving, Volvo has all of your bases covered. The Pilot Assist system – standard on higher trim models – helps keep the car in a safe driving lane and maintains the correct speed and distance between you and the vehicle in front.</p>
                    <p class="text">For passenger safety, Volvo offers internal airbags and a rollover protection system. The rollover protection system kicks in if the car flips and automatically deploys a built-in roll cage, additional tethers and front headrests to protect the occupants.</p>
                    <p class="text">The combination of both active and passive safety features means Volvo customers can enjoy the peace of mind and safe driving experience they’re accustomed to.</p>
