                    <p class="text">The earliest written accounts of these interactions come from ancient Greek sailors who described encounters between sharks and dolphins during their voyages.</p>
                    <p class="text">Dolphins have often been seen riding on the backs of sharks, or playing in close proximity with them.</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <p class="text"> Sharks and dolphins usually interact peacefully, though it is believed that dolphins may use shark body language to try and ward off potential threats. In some cases, dolphins have even been seen chasing away or attacking sharks, or driving them away from fishing areas.</p>
                        <p class="text"> Generally, dolphins are not a target of shark predation, and sharks don't actively hunt dolphins like they do other fish, but the two species have been known to get in to skirmishes on occasion. In these cases, dolphins are usually the victors.</p>
                        <p class="text text-alt"> In recent years, animal researchers have begun studying this relationship in more detail.</p>
                        <p class="text"> It seems that sharks and dolphins have managed to coexist in the same habitats peacefully, often having beneficial effects on each otherâs lives, such as providing mutual protection from potential predators.</p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">These observations have gone a long way in helping us understand the complex dynamics between sharks and dolphins, and why the two species often live in harmony together.</p>

                            <li class="text">Sharks are highly territorial and will often attack if they feel their territory is being encroached upon. By swimming in large groups, dolphins can act as a deterrent to deter sharks from attacking as they can scare the shark away.</li>
                            <li class="text">Additionally, dolphins create a vocal noise that attracts sharks away from swimmers and surfers, thereby reducing the chance of an attack.</li>
                            <li class="text">Furthermore, dolphins have even been known to intervene if they believe a person is in danger, pushing them to safety with their bodies and preventing a potential attack.</li>
