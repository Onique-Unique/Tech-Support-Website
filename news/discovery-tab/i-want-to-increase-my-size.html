Protein is the building block of muscle, and it's essential for muscle growth and development. A diet high in protein will help you maintain and even increase your muscle mass.

                            <li class="text">Additionally, don't forget to stay hydrated! Adequate water consumption is necessary for flushing toxins from the body, keeping your muscles hydrated, and ensuring that you get the nutrients you need.</li>

                    <p class="text">No matter your age, size is something that can always be increased! Eating the right foods can help you reach your goals in no time.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are a few of the top foods for size increase that you should consider adding to your diet:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Protein-Rich Foods: Protein is the building block of muscle and helps with muscle repair and growth. You should aim to get at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Be sure to include lean sources of protein like chicken, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts.</li>
                            <li class="text">Carbohydrates-Dense Foods: Carbs are an essential fuel source and provide the energy needed to get through a workout. Aim to get at least 45 to 60 percent of your daily caloric intake from carbs. Some good high-carbohydrate foods are oatmeal, whole grain bread, brown rice, and sweet potatoes.</li>
                            <li class="text">Healthy Fats: Fats are an essential part of our diets and should never be cut out. Healthy sources of fat include avocado, nuts, and fatty fish like salmon and mackerel.</li>
