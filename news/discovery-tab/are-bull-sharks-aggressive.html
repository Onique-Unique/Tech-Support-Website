                    <p class="text">Bull sharks are one of the most feared predators in the ocean! Known for having a ferocious bite and an aggressive attitude, they are a force to be reckoned with.</p>
                    <p class="text">But what can you do to protect yourself while swimming or boating near them?</p>
                    <p class="text">Understanding the behavior and habitats of these creatures will help you stay safe and assure an enjoyable water experience.</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <p class="text"> Bull sharks are mainly found in warm coastal waters of the world's major oceans and a few large rivers. They prefer water temperatures between 21 and 25 degrees Celsius, so they often come close to shore between July and October, when the water is the warmest.</p>
                        <p class="text"> Though they can grow to be up to 11 feet long, bull sharks are usually encountered in shallow water close to shore. They are territorial, so it’s best to avoid swimming where you can see them.</p>
                        <p class="text text-alt"> Bull sharks can be very aggressive. They’re not picky eaters and will feed on almost anything; from fish, shellfish, and invertebrates to small mammals, birds, and even garbage.</p>
                        <p class="text"> Don’t forget that these predators can turn their attention to people, if they’re hungry or disturbed. As such, it’s important to be aware of your surroundings when in the water.</p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">Though bull sharks can be intimidating, it’s important to remember that they prefer to avoid humans.</p>
                    <p class="text">Use common sense when swimming or boating in areas where they’re known to inhabit and always be aware of your surroundings. If you see one, back away quietly and never attempt to touch or corner it.</p>
                    <p class="text">By understanding the behavior and habitats of bull sharks, you can enjoy water activities with a greater sense of security and safety. With some knowledge and respect for these powerful creatures, it can be a truly thrilling experience.</p>

                            <li class="text">Swim in areas with lifeguards present. Lifeguards are well-trained in spotting potential risk areas to help keep you safe.</li>
                            <li class="text">Swim in groups. Sharks are more likely to approach lone swimmers and the presence of a pair or group can be an effective deterrent.</li>
                            <li class="text">Wear bright colors. Sharks are attracted to basic colors like black, blue, and gray so wearing bright colors like yellow can make you more visible and alert sharks to stay away.</li>
                            <li class="text">Avoid areas known for shark traffic. There are certain times and seasons when sharks are more likely to be found, so research these spots and take extra caution when swimming in those areas.</li>
                            <li class="text">Never swim with open wounds or bleeding. Sharks can smell blood from long distances and it can attract them. It’s best to avoid swimming or remaining in the water if you have open wounds.</li>
                            <li class="text">Stay away from fish and marine life. Sharks are carnivores and will start to investigate if they see you swimming near fish. This can increase the chance of an encounter.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Sharks are out to get us and attack people all the time – Sharks generally aren't interested in humans and people are not their preferred prey. The chance of being attacked by a shark is actually very small and they attack people far less than most legends and stories would suggest.</li>
                            <li class="text">All sharks are dangerous – Many people think that every shark species is dangerous, but this is far from true. In fact, the most common type of sharks that people swim with, the Whale Shark, has actually never caused any human fatalities.</li>
                            <li class="text">Sharks are mindless predators that hunt their prey relentlessly – Sharks are actually highly intelligent creatures that react to their environment in a variety of ways. They search for prey, hunt for food, and demonstrate a wide range of different strategies when it comes to catching their meals.</li>
                            <li class="text">Sharks are loners – Sharks are actually very social creatures, especially around communal hunting grounds. You will often find them in large groups and they can even recognize each other and form long-term relationships.</li>
                            <li class="text">Sharks eat just about anything they come across – Sharks are actually very choosy when it comes to food, and usually prefer fish and marine mammals. Sharks have been known to go several days without food, waiting to find the right meal.</li>
