                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Get organized: Be sure to gather all the information you’ll need to fill out your tax return, such as your W2, bills, bank statements and other financial documents. Being organized and having all your information on hand will make preparing your tax return quick and painless.</li>
                            <li class="text">Take advantage of deductions and credits: Be sure to claim all the deductions and credits you’re eligible for. TurboTax will help you find any deductions and credits you’re eligible for and guide you through the tax filing process, so you can keep more of your hard-earned money.</li>
                            <li class="text">Double-check your return: Always make sure to double-check your return to ensure everything is correct. Before filing, review your personal information, tax forms and deductions to make sure everything is accurate and all the necessary forms are included.</li>
                            <li class="text">File electronically: Filing your return electronically is the simplest and most secure way to file. TurboTax makes it easy – there are step-by-step instructions and help along the way, which almost eliminates the chance for costly mistakes.</li>
                            <li class="text">Sign up for direct deposit: Signing up for direct deposit when you file your tax return will get you the fastest refund possible - typically within three to five days. And, with direct deposit, you can rest assured that your tax return will be deposited securely, directly into your bank account.</li>
                            <li class="text">Invest in yourself: TurboTax can help you take advantage of potential investment opportunities. It can help you invest in yourself and turn your tax refund into something that can help you long-term.
