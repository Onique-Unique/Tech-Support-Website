                            <li class="text">Bring something to relax you. Whether it be a book, music, podcasts, or video games, bringing something that can help you pass the time (and take your mind off of your stress) can be really helpful.</li>
                            <li class="text">Have snacks and drinks ready. By bringing along snacks and drinks, you'll be prepared in case of delays or turbulence. You'll have something to refuel and calm your nerves.</li>
                            <li class="text">Dress comfortably. That bulky jacket will be a nuisance during a long flight. Look for clothing that won't constrict and that you can move around in. This can help you feel more relaxed and comfortable.</li>
                            <li class="text">Ask for help. If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to ask airport personnel or your fellow passengers for help. You don't need to tackle your worries alone.</li>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-3">How to prepare for a long flight?</h2>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Dress comfortably: Make sure to dress in clothes that are comfortable and not too restrictive. This will help you stay relaxed during the flight.</li>
                            <li class="text">Bring your own snacks: Bringing your own snacks will help you stay energized during your long flight.</li>
                            <li class="text">Donât overpack: Overpacking can make your flight more uncomfortable and take up too much space in the overhead bin. Only bring what you need on the flight.</li>
                            <li class="text">Bring a book: Pass the time on your flight by bringing a book with you. Itâs a great way to keep yourself entertained for hours.</li>
                            <li class="text">Have important documents handy: Have your passport, ticket and/or boarding pass readily available as you may need to quickly access them at the airport.</li>
                            <li class="text">Wear noise-canceling headphones: Invest in headphones that cancel out the noise from the plane. This will help drown out your fellow passengers and make your flight more enjoyable.</li>
                            <li class="text">Stretch: Make sure to stretch throughout your flight. This can help with in-flight soreness and keep the blood flowing.</li>
                            <li class="text">Keep yourself hydrated: Bring a reusable water bottle with you own the plane and keep yourself hydrated with water throughout your flight.</li>
                            <li class="text">Get up and move: Every once in awhile get up and move around the plane. This can help relieve some of the stress of sitting in one position for too long.</li>
                            <li class="text">Schedule some rest: Before you leave for your flight, make sure to schedule some rest beforehand. This will help you stay energized during the flight.</li>
