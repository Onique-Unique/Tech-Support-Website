                            <li class="text">Reusable water bottle: Stay hydrated during the flight with a reusable water bottle and fill it up on the plane.</li>
                            <li class="text">Snacks: Pack some healthy snacks you like such as nuts, protein bars or fruit for when hunger strikes.</li>

                            <li class="text">Plan ahead. When you know the specifics of the flight, researching them ahead of time will help to reduce stress. Be sure to take into account flight times, ticket changes, and connecting flights.</li>
                            <li class="text">Don't let your worries escalate. Anxiety levels can get higher the more you think about the flight. Instead, focus on the positive aspects of your journey, such as the destination or the fact that you get to travel.</li>
                            <li class="text">Bring something to relax you. Whether it be a book, music, podcasts, or video games, bringing something that can help you pass the time (and take your mind off of your stress) can be really helpful.</li>
                            <li class="text">Have snacks and drinks ready. By bringing along snacks and drinks, you'll be prepared in case of delays or turbulence. You'll have something to refuel and calm your nerves.</li>
                            <li class="text">Dress comfortably. That bulky jacket will be a nuisance during a long flight. Look for clothing that won't constrict and that you can move around in. This can help you feel more relaxed and comfortable.</li>
                            <li class="text">Ask for help. If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to ask airport personnel or your fellow passengers for help. You don't need to tackle your worries alone.</li>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-3">How to prepare for a long flight?</h2>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Dress comfortably: Make sure to dress in clothes that are comfortable and not too restrictive. This will help you stay relaxed during the flight.</li>
                            <li class="text">Bring your own snacks: Bringing your own snacks will help you stay energized during your long flight.</li>
                            <li class="text">Don’t overpack: Overpacking can make your flight more uncomfortable and take up too much space in the overhead bin. Only bring what you need on the flight.</li>
                            <li class="text">Bring a book: Pass the time on your flight by bringing a book with you. It’s a great way to keep yourself entertained for hours.</li>
                            <li class="text">Have important documents handy: Have your passport, ticket and/or boarding pass readily available as you may need to quickly access them at the airport.</li>
                            <li class="text">Wear noise-canceling headphones: Invest in headphones that cancel out the noise from the plane. This will help drown out your fellow passengers and make your flight more enjoyable.</li>
                            <li class="text">Stretch: Make sure to stretch throughout your flight. This can help with in-flight soreness and keep the blood flowing.</li>
                            <li class="text">Keep yourself hydrated: Bring a reusable water bottle with you own the plane and keep yourself hydrated with water throughout your flight.</li>
                            <li class="text">Get up and move: Every once in awhile get up and move around the plane. This can help relieve some of the stress of sitting in one position for too long.</li>
                            <li class="text">Schedule some rest: Before you leave for your flight, make sure to schedule some rest beforehand. This will help you stay energized during the flight.</li>
