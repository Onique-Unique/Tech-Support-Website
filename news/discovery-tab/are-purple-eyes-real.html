                        <p class="text"> Our eyes contain special cells called melanocytes which produce melanin, which then determines the color of the iris. There are two types of melanin that control eye color â eumelanin, which produces shades of brown, and pheomelanin, which produces shades of red and yellow.</p>
                        <p class="text"> The concentration of melanin in the cells is what determines eye color. For example, if there is more eumelanin in the cells, then the eye color will be darker, and if there is more pheomelanin, the eye color will be lighter.</p>
                        <p class="text"> Factors like genetics and environment, such as a personâs diet, can also affect eye color, or even cause it to change over time.</p>

                    <p class="text">Different eye colors can have historical and cultural significance in many parts of the world. For example, green eyes are often associated with beauty and mystery in many cultures.</p>
                    <p class="text">In the Middle Ages, people thought green eyes were a sign of good luck and brought unconditional love and admiration for those who possessed them.</p>
                    <p class="text">It was also believed that having green eyes brought good fortune in the form of abundance in life.</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">In some Asian cultures, black eyes are seen as a sign of honesty, trustworthiness, and devotion.</li>
                            <li class="text">Brown eyes are seen as a sign of steadiness and strength, while blue eyes often represent loyalty, gentleness, and wisdom.</li>
                            <li class="text">In many cultures, hazel eyes are seen as a sign of intelligence, curiosity, and quick-wittedness.</li>

                    <br>
                    <p class="text">Ultimately, the cultural significance of different eye colors varies drastically depending on the culture and beliefs of the observer.</p>
                    <p class="text">It is important to recognize that all eye colors are equally beautiful and no one eye color is more special than another.</p>
