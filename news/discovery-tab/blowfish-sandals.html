                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-2">How to find the right fit for blowfish sandals?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Finding the perfect pair of blowfish sandals can be tricky, but knowing your style and what fits your foot can make the process a whole lot easier!</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are a few tips that should help you find the perfect fit:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Know what material you’re looking for. Different materials have different stretches and fits, so make sure you choose something that accommodates your foot the best.</li>
                            <li class="text">Try them on in-store before making a purchase. Blowfish sandals come in lots of styles and sizes, so trying on a couple pairs in-store can help you narrow down your search.</li>
                            <li class="text">Consider heel and ankle straps. Heel and ankle straps can add additional support and comfort, so it’s worth taking a look at the different straps Blowfish offers.</li>
                            <li class="text">Make sure it fits! The most important thing is to make sure the sandals fit your feet comfortably and securely. Don’t be afraid to size up or down to get the perfect fit.</li>
                            <li class="text">Pay attention to the reviews. Reviews can be really helpful in finding the right sandals. Read through the reviews of different Blowfish styles to get a good feel for how they fit and how comfortable they are.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">For those with wide or high-arched feet, easy-to-wear slip-in sandals may be the ideal choice. These sandals offer a relaxed and cozy fit, with an adjustable strap or buckle for added security and ease of wear.</li>
                            <li class="text">For those with narrow or low-arched feet, thong sandals can be ideal and provide a snugger, supportive fit. These sandals often feature a contoured footbed to help stabilize the foot and prevent foot slippage and discomfort.</li>
                            <li class="text">Don’t forget about the options for those with orthopedic foot conditions such as plantar fasciitis. Orthotic sandals provide superior arch support and cushioning for added comfort and relief. They may also feature a secure, adjustable strap to ensure a secure fit.</li>
                            <li class="text">Finally, adjustable strap sandals are a great choice for those that have normal to wide feet. These sandals often feature multiple straps that can be tightened or loosened to provide a customized fit.</li>
