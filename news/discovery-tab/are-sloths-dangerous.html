                        <p class="text"> Sloths communicate through body language, smell, vocalizations, and facial expressions. When a sloth feels threatened or scared, their behavior suggests their anxiety.</p>
                        <p class="text"> They will freeze in place and become less active in order to avoid detection by predators. They may also lower their heads and stay hunched in a tight ball, in an effort to look smaller.</p>
                        <p class="text"> If further threatened, sloths may lunge forward with their limbs to attack or ward off an aggressor.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="text">A happy and relaxed sloth moves differently than a frightened one. They may become more active, stretching and looking up at their surroundings with curious eyes.</p>
                    <p class="text">They will also vocalize, emitting low-level grunts, clicks, and whistles as signs of contentment.</p>
                    <p class="text">Getting to know these behaviors can help us appreciate and protect this species. Every sloth is an individual with its own preferences, needs, and ways of communicating.</p>

                    <p class="text">Did you know that sloths are surprisingly strong?</p>
                    <p class="text">While they may look slow and clumsy, they can hang onto branches with a crushing grip that weighs up to five times the animal's body weight!</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Sloths are truly unique creatures. Contrary to popular belief, they aren't true hibernators. Instead, these furry friends like to take 'power naps' throughout the day and only sleep for periods of around 9-10 hours each night.</li>
                            <li class="text">Sloths also have some rather unusual eating habits. Although sloths are classed as folivores, meaning they're herbivores that feed mainly on leaves, they'll sometimes snack on insects and other small animals.</li>
                            <li class="text">Another fun fact about sloths is that they have incredibly low metabolisms and can go up to a month without eating.</li>
                            <li class="text">They also produce an impressively low body temperature, averaging around 8 Celsius, to conserve energy and help keep them camouflaged.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">As for myths about sloths, a common one is that they often get mistaken for monkeys.</p>
                    <p class="text">Despite their slow pace, these creatures are actually mammals and more closely related to primates than to any other animals.</p>
