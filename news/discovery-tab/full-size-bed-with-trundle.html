                            <li class="text">One type of trundle bed is a daybed with trundle. A daybed works as a full-size bed by day, and you can use the trundle underneath to store bedding or toys. On nights when you need the extra sleeping space, you can simply pull out the trundle to create an extra sleeping surface.</li>
                            <li class="text">Another type of trundle bed is a platform bed frame with a pull out trundle underneath. This type of trundle bed is perfect for smaller bedrooms as it will give you a full-size bed when you need it and a twin bed when you donât. You can also store bedding, toys, or clothes in the trundle in between uses.</li>
                            <li class="text">Finally, you can also get bunk beds with built-in trundles. These beds are great for both adults and kids, as you can have a twin-size bed on top, a full-size bed on the bottom, and a trundle that can stay tucked out of sight below.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-2">Advantages of having a trundle in your bed:</h2>
                    <p class="text">If you are looking to upgrade your bedroom without having to invest too much money, a trundle bed is the perfect solution.</p>
                    <p class="text">A trundle bed is a great space-saving solution, providing extra sleeping space without taking up too much extra space.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are some of the key advantages of having a trundle in your bed:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Income opportunities - For Rental/ Airbnb Hosts: If you are short on space, but you need room for extra guests, a trundle bed can provide additional income opportunities. Having a trundle bed in your home means that you can offer your guests extra space when needed, as well as a comfortable and convenient place for them to stay.</li>
                            <li class="text">Comfort - When you are lying in your trundle bed, you will be able to enjoy the added comfort of having a mattress that is higher than the main bed. This allows you to get a better night's sleep, as the raised bed helps to reduce back pressure and neck pain.</li>
                            <li class="text">Practical - Not only is a trundle bed great for saving space, it also makes it much easier to move beds around the house when you need to rearrange furniture. The wheels allow you to move the bed easily, without requiring much effort.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Maximize storage space by buying full size storage beds with drawers. This is perfect for couples who share a bed, as both sides will have plenty of extra storage for blankets, clothes, and extra pillows.</li>
                            <li class="text">Splurge on cozy bedding and a mattress topper to make the most out of your full size trundle bed. Itâs important to invest in quality products so you can get a good nights sleep.</li>
                            <li class="text">Place durable and decorative trunks at the foot of the bed. Use them to store out of season clothing, books, or extra toys.</li>
                            <li class="text">Position low-profile furniture underneath the trundle bed. This will provide additional seating or storage space without making the room feel cramped.</li>
                            <li class="text">Add a few statement pieces like a headboard or bench. Draw attention to the bed by making sure itâs the focus of your bedroom.</li>
                            <li class="text">Utilize wall space rather than floor space. Put up shelves, cabinets, or wall art to make your room appear more spacious.</li>
                            <li class="text">Layer your bedding with one large blanket, one medium blanket, a bedspread, and decorative pillows. This will create a cozy and inviting bed.</li>
                            <li class="text">Experiment with different colors and patterns. This could be just the inspiration you need to transform your room into one you truly love.</li>
