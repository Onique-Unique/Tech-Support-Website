                    <p class="text">These options allow you to transform an outfit to fit many occasions and activities.</p>

                            <li class="text">For example, adjustable ankle straps on a pair of shoes can take you from the office to a night out on the town, while adjustable drawstrings on a skirt or pants make it easy to adjust the fit and length to flatter your figure.</li>
                            <li class="text">Versatile and adjustable wardrobe pieces can also help you save money. By investing in key pieces that can be reworked, reinvigorated and accessorized, you can create an infinite range of outfits without breaking the bank.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Make sure you have the right tools: A tailor's tape measure is an essential tool for accurately measuring your clothing size. If you don’t have one, you can use a regular measuring tape or a ruler.</li>
                            <li class="text">Start with your bust: Your bust size is the most important measurement because it determines the rest of your size. Measure right across your chest, halfway between your shoulder and your elbow.</li>
                            <li class="text">Record your waist: To find your waist size, measure around your belly, at the smallest part of your midsection.</li>
                            <li class="text">Measure the hips: Measure around the fullest part of the hips, usually about 8 inches below the waist.</li>
                            <li class="text">Double-check each measurement: The trickiest part of getting your size accurately is making sure your measurements are exact. So make sure to double check them before you write them down!</li>
                            <li class="text">Find the size chart for your brand: Different brands have different size charts. So make sure you use the right one for the clothing you’re buying, so it fits you perfectly.</li>
