                    <p class="text">Intermittent fasting is a great way to give your body a break and help jumpstart a healthier diet.</p>
                    <p class="text">It can help you reduce your calorie intake, improve your metabolism and overall health. Adding intermittent fasting into your daily routine may be intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be hard.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are some tips on how to incorporate an intermittent fasting diet into your routine:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Determine your fasting time. Pick a set time and period in which to fast. A typical fasting time is anywhere from 16-20 hours. This means that you’ll be skipping breakfast, lunch and any snacks, and limiting your eating window to 4-8 hours.</li>
                            <li class="text">Set a clear goal. Before starting your fasting, determine what your goals are. If your goal is to lose weight, decide on whether you want to cut 500 or 1000 calories a day. If your main goal is to improve your overall health and wellbeing, aim to follow this diet for a couple of weeks and see how you feel.</li>
                            <li class="text">Meal plan. Once you know when your fasting period is, plan meals that will supply the nutrition you need during the remaining eating window. Make sure you are getting enough vitamins and minerals like fruits, vegetables and lean proteins.</li>
                            <li class="text">Keep it simple. Don’t overwhelm yourself by always preparing and consuming a lot of differently flavored dishes. Pick simple meals and snacks that are easy and convenient to make, like oatmeal and smoothies.</li>
                            <li class="text">Stay hydrated. Drinking lots of water during your fasting period is important. It will keep you hydrated and help your body burn fat.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">By following these tips, your body will get used to your new routine and you’ll reap the benefits of intermittent fasting. Good luck!</p>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-2">Common myths about Intermittent Fasting and the science behind it:</h2>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Myth: Intermittent fasting is just another fad diet.</li>
                            <li class="text">Truth: Intermittent fasting (IF) is a scientifically backed approach to health and wellness that has been around for centuries. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests IF provides numerous health benefits. Studies suggest that IF can help you lose weight and improve cognitive function, reduce cancer risk, and reduce markers of chronic disease.</li>
                            <li class="text">Myth: You’ll go into starvation mode if you practice intermittent fasting.</li>
                            <li class="text">Truth: Starvation mode is a myth and is not in any way supported by science. Intermittent fasting is a natural cycle of eating and abstaining from food. The body can easily adapt to short periods of fasting and use the periods in between meals to secrete hormones, such as glucagon, which actually help with fat burning.</li>
                            <li class="text">Myth: Intermittent fasting is only for weight loss.</li>
                            <li class="text">Truth: Intermittent fasting is about much more than just weight loss.

It can also reduce your risk of developing metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes.</li>
