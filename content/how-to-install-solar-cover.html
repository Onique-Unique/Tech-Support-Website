                            <p class="text"> Installing solar cover reel straps can be a daunting task if you have never done it before. It is definitely a two-person job. The first step is to measure the distance between the posts on your reel. This is the length you will need to order your straps. </p>
                            <p class="text"> Once you have the straps, the next step is to install them. The easiest way to do this is to have one person hold the strap while the other person tightens the bolt. Make sure the strap is tight against the post and that the reel is in the correct position before moving on to the next strap. </p>
                            <p class="text"> It is a good idea to use a level when installing the reel to make sure it is straight. You may also want to use a marker to make a line on the ground where the reel should sit. This will help ensure that the reel stays in the same spot each time you use it. </p>
