                        <p class="text">In this tutorial, you will learn how to draw an anime girl with short hair step by step. Anime girls with short hair can be very cute, and there are many different ways to draw them.</p>
                        <p class="text">For this tutorial, we will be using the following reference image:</p>
                        <div class="div-container">
                            <p class="text"> To begin, sketch out the basic outline of the character's head and body. Be sure to make the body and head relatively proportional.</p>
                            <p class="text"> Next, begin to add the details of the character's face. Draw the eyes, nose, and mouth. You can also add some simple curves to indicate the shape of the cheeks and chin.</p>
                            <p class="text"> Now, begin to add the hair. For this tutorial, we will be drawing short hair, so there is not a lot of detail needed. Simply draw a few short lines to indicate the hair's shape and length.</p>
                            <p class="text"> Finally, add in any final details and colorings, and you're done!</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li class="text">Start by drawing a basic outline of the head and neck.</li>
                                <li class="text">Next, draw in the facial features. For the eyes, start by drawing a large oval shape. Inside the oval, draw a smaller oval for the pupil.</li>
                                <li class="text">Next, draw the eyebrows and eyelashes. For the eyebrows, draw a thin line above the eyes. For the eyelashes, draw a few short lines above the eyes.</li>
                                <li class="text">Draw the hair. For this tutorial, we'll be drawing short hair, so don't worry about drawing lots of hair. Just draw a few short lines to represent the hair.</li>
                                <li class="text">Finally, color in the anime girl's hair and clothes. And that's it! You've now drawn an anime girl with short hair.</li>

                        <p class="text">There are a few things you need to remember when drawing anime girls with short hair realistically. </p>
                        <div class="div-container">
                            <ul>
                                <li class="text">For starters, short hair is not just one length; it can be short in the back and longer in the front, or shorter on the sides and longer in the middle, etc. </li>
                                <li class="text">So, when drawing short hair, you need to be aware of the different lengths and how they'll affect the overall look of the hairstyle.</li>
                                <li class="text">Another thing to consider is the texture of the hair. Short hair can be spiky, wavy, or straight, and each type of hair has its own unique look. </li>
                                <li class="text">So, if you want your anime girl's hair to look realistic, you need to be aware of the different hair textures and how to draw them correctly.</li>
                                <li class="text">Lastly, don't forget to add some personality to your character's hairstyle. Just because they have short hair doesn't mean they can't have an interesting or unique hairstyle. So, be creative and have fun with it!</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="text text-alt"> You can either leave the hair straight or give it a bit of a curl. Next, add the details of the clothes and accessories. </p>
                            <p class="text"> For the clothes, you can either keep it simple with a plain t-shirt and jeans, or give her a more stylish look with a dress or skirt. Finally, add the finishing touches to the drawing and you're done! </p>
