                    <p class="text">By applying a ceramic coating it essentially acts as a protective layer of paint that is applied to a surface. This sort of coating is commonly used on automobiles because it protects the paint from weathering and fading.</p>
                    <p class="text">A ceramic coating has massive benefits that protect your car's paint exterior, including protection from the environment, increased durability, and a longer lifespan for the painted surface.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight">What is ceramic coating?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Ceramic coating is an innovative technique designed to maintain and improve the appearance of vehicle paintwork. It is a spray-on, polymer-based coating that forms a robust, permanent layer on the surface of the paint, protecting it from scratches, swirl marks, water spots, rock chips, and other types of damage.</p>
                    <p class="text">Ceramic coating also improves the gloss and depth of color of the paint, as well as making the paint surface resistant to water and grime.</p>
