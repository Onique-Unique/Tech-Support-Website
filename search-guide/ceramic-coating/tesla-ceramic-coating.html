It's a popular vehicle, and many people want to know how much it costs to have the ceramic coating applied to it.\n\nThe coating is a very thin layer applied to the vehicle. It aids in the protection of the paint from scratches and chips. It also makes the car appear new and shiny. The price of the coating varies according to the size of the vehicle.\n\nThe cost for a Tesla Model 3 is $995.00. This price includes the cost of the coating and the labor. The coating will last for about five years, and will need to be reapplied every few years."

                "text": "There is no denying that Teslas are among the most stunning vehicles on the road. In addition to having excellent performance and luxurious features, they also offer a distinctive and fashionable appearance. But whether or not to ceramic coat a Tesla is one matter that frequently comes up.\n\nThere are several considerations to evaluate when considering whether or not to ceramic coat a Tesla. The first is the cost. Ceramic coating can be expensive, therefore it's vital to be sure the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nAnother consideration is the age of the car.\n\nIf a Tesla is relatively new, the paint is likely in good condition and doesn't need to be ceramic coated as newer models are expected to already arrive with this feature. However, if a Tesla is older, the paint may be starting to show signs of wear and could benefit from the protection that a ceramic coating provides."

                                    <li class="text">There are several considerations to evaluate when considering whether or not to ceramic coat a Tesla. The first is the cost. Ceramic coating can be expensive, therefore it's vital to be sure the benefits outweigh the costs.</li>

                                <p class="text">Another consideration is the age of the car.</p>

                                    <li class="text">If a Tesla is relatively new, the paint is likely in good condition and doesn't need to be ceramic coated as newer models are expected to already arrive with this feature. However, if a Tesla is older, the paint may be starting to show signs of wear, scratch, swirl mark, UV damage etc, and adding ceramic coating can offer many benefits from tesla protection of the paint surface, UV protection and even paint correction.</li>
                                </ul>

If you feel like the benefits outweigh the cost, then go for it! But if you're not sure, it's best to consult with a local professional to get their opinion.</p>

One option is to use a product like Cquartz UK, which is a firm, durable ceramic coating that anybody can apply.

                                <p class="text">Another alternative is to apply a coat of paint, such as Cerakote, which is a ceramic-based paint that is applied to the body of your car. It is more resistant to scratches and fading than conventional paint.</p>
                                <p class="text">Recently many tesla owners have been ceramic coating their car and to my knowledge it is a great idea! Not only does it make the car look super cool, but it also protects it from scratches and chips. Based on a little research, there are a few companies that offer this service.</p>
                                <p class="text">There is specifically one company called Ceramic Pro that offers a few different options, but going with the full package, this includes paint correction and paint protection  that can also be applied to the wheels, the glass, and the interior. It's a little pricey, but it's definitely worth it.</p>
