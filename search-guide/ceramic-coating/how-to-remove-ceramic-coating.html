                    <p class="text">Although removing ceramic coating can be difficult, it can be done safely and effectively with the correct equipment and methods. In this post, we'll explain a number of safe and simple techniques for removing ceramic coating, including chemical and mechanical removal.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight">What to do before removing ceramic coating?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Before removing ceramic coating, there are a few things you can do to make the procedure go more smoothly. To begin, make sure the surface is clean and clear of dirt, dust, or debris.</p>
                    <p class="text">To help remove any stubborn contaminants, apply a cleanser or degreaser. Second, ensure that the surface is completely dry.</p>
                    <p class="text">When applying a wet coating on a wet surface, the coating may bubble and peel. It is quite easier to use a lacquer thinner to weaken the coating and make removal easier.</p>
                    <p class="text">Make sure to follow all of the product label's safety instructions, and always test a small area first to ensure that the coating will not damage the surface.</p>

                                <p class="text">Yes, you can remove ceramic coating with a clay bar. However, it's important to be gentle and take your time, since you don't want to damage the coating. Start by wetting the clay bar, then rubbing it over the surface of the coating. Move slowly and be careful not to apply too much pressure.</p>
                                <p class="text">If the clay bar starts to dry out, wet it again. When you're finished, make sure to rinse the surface thoroughly to remove all the clay.</p>

                                <p class="text">Glass with a ceramic coating can be challenging to remove. There are a few methods to go about it, but using a solvent is the best option. </p>
                                <p class="text">A nice option is acetone because it will swiftly dissolve the coating. However, because it is a flammable solvent, use caution when working with it. Ceramic coating on glass can be removed in a few different methods. You can either dissolve it with oven cleaner or scrape it off with a razor blade. When employing either technique, make sure to ventilate the room adequately and use gloves and goggles.</p>

                                <p class="text">Acetone is likely to act on ceramic coatings if the coating is not too thick. It will also be determined by the sort of ceramic coating employed. Acetone may be able to remove the coating if it is not very robust. However, acetone may not be able to remove the coating if it is very hard and lasting.</p>

                                <p class="text">It all relies on the type of ceramic coating on your vehicle. If it is a thin, water-based coating, dish soap or dawn would most likely remove it. However, if the coating is thicker and solvent-based, it is likely to be resistant to dish soap/ dawn.</p>
                                <p class="text">In general, test a small section of your automobile with dish soap or dawn before scrubbing it all over. This will assist you in determining whether it will be effective in removing the ceramic coating.</p>
                                <p class="text">Even at the end of this a definite answer is hard to come by as to whether dish soap/ dawn will remove ceramic coating or not. Some people say that it does, while others say that it does not. What is known for sure, however, is that dish soap/ dawn is a powerful detergent that can remove dirt and grease.</p>
                                <p class="text">So, if your ceramic coating is dirty or greasy, then dish soap/ dawn may be able to remove it. But if your ceramic coating is in good condition, then dish soap/ dawn is likely not going to cause any damage.</p>
