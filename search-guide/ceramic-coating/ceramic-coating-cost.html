                    <p class="text">There is no set price for ceramic coating, as the cost can vary depending on the size of your vehicle, the type of coating used, and the location of the coating company. </p>
                    <p class="text">However, you can ceramic coat your car for less than $100. There are a few things you can do to reduce the cost of ceramic coating: choose a smaller car, use a lower-quality coating, or find a company that offers a lower price.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight">What is ceramic coating and what are the benefits?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Ceramic coating is a clear or translucent liquid that is applied to a surface to keep it from corroding and wearing away. It's also known as a liquid glass coating, and it may be applied to metal, plastic, and wood surfaces.</p>
                    <p class="text">Ceramic coating is a popular choice among car enthusiasts because it can protect the finish of a vehicle from corrosion and wear. It can also make the paint work on the car look shiny and new.</p>

Not only does it protect the hull from scratches and damage, but it can also help to keep the boat looking new for many years.</p>
                                <p class="text">The cost of ceramic coating for boats can vary depending on the size of the boat, the type of ceramic coating material used, and the application process. Generally, the cost ranges from $500 to $2,000 per boat. Boat owners should consider the cost of ceramic coating when making a decision about whether to have the coating applied.</p>

                                <p class="text">The cost of ceramic coating an automobile is determined by a variety of factors. The type of coating, the size of the vehicle, and the location of the facility performing the job all have an impact. In general, a full ceramic coating on a compact car will cost roughly $1,000. </p>
                                <p class="text">Larger vehicles may be more expensive, and luxury vehicles may be even more so. Consider having a coating done at a company that provides a package deal if you want to save money.</p>
