                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-3">What materials are dishwasher safe and why to avoid others?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Making sure that you can use your dishwasher without worrying about damaging your dishes is essential for a stress-free cleaning experience.</p>
                    <p class="text">Knowing which materials are safe for your dishwasher can save you a lot of time and effort.</p>
                    <p class="text"> Let's look at some of the materials that are actually safe to put in your dishwasher and why it’s best to avoid some of the others:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Stainless Steel: This material is generally a safe choice, as it's durable and doesn't change shape or corrode when exposed to heat and moisture.</li>
                            <li class="text">Glass: Generally, glass is a safe material to put in your dishwasher. This is because glass heats up quickly and is able to withstand the temperatures.</li>
                            <li class="text">Ceramic: Plates, bowls, and other dinnerware made of ceramic can usually be put in the dishwasher, as long as they are glazed. This glaze helps to protect the material from damage due to the heat and moisture.</li>
                            <li class="text">Wood:Wooden dishes and utensils should not be put in the dishwasher as the heat can cause warping and splitting. Additionally, the moisture in the dishwasher will cause the wood to swell and control, eventually leading to cracking.</li>
                            <li class="text">Plastics: Plastics can melt if exposed to high temperatures. Additionally, harsh detergents and cleaning agents used in dishwashers can cause cloudy buildup and leaching of chemicals from the plastic.</li>
                            <li class="text">Cast Iron: Cast iron should be avoided at all costs, as the high temperatures and moisture can damage the surface and cause it to rust.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p class="text">It's important to know which materials are safe to use in your dishwasher and which ones should be avoided.</p>
                    <p class="text">Stainless steel, glass, and ceramic materials are generally safe, while wood, plastics, and cast iron should be washed by hand.</p>

                            <li class="text">Removable parts: It’s also important to make sure that the Crock Pot you choose has removable parts that can be safely placed in the dishwasher.

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-8">Alternatives to dishwasher cleaning for Crock Pots:</h2>
                    <p class="text">Crock pots can make meal prepping a breeze—but having to clean them afterward can be less than enjoyable.</p>
                    <p class="text"> Luckily, there are several alternatives to dishwasher cleaning that can help you keep your crock pot looking and running like new.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are four DIY methods to keep your Crock Pot nice and clean without having to resort to using a dishwasher:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Boil Water - Fill your Crock Pot with water (about halfway) and bring it to a boil. This will create steam that can help loosen stuck-on food particles, making it easier to wipe away. Plus, hot water is known to kill any germs or bacteria that may be in your Crock Pot.</li>
                            <li class="text">White Vinegar and Baking Soda - Create a paste using equal parts white vinegar and baking soda. Apply the paste to any areas of your Crock Pot that are stained or have visible residue. Give it a few hours to sit before wiping it away with a damp cloth.</li>
                            <li class="text">Lemon Juice and Cream of Tartar - Combine equal parts lemon juice and cream of tartar to create a powerful cleaning paste. With a damp cloth, gently scrub the affected area to help breakdown and remove stuck-on foods.</li>
                            <li class="text">Automatic Dishwasher Cleaner - If you don't want to try out any of the other options, this is the closest alternative to using a dishwasher. Simply fill the Crock Pot with water, add a packet of automatic dishwasher cleaner, and give it a good stir. Let it sit for about 60 minutes before wiping it away with a cloth.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">These alternatives are all effective for cleaning your Crock Pot, though using a dishwasher may still be the best option for more stubborn food residues.</p>
                    <p class="text">Ultimately, it’s up to you to determine which method works best for your needs.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Remove the stoneware insert from the heating element, and dry both parts of the Crock Pot with a soft cloth after the dishwashing process is finished.</li>
                            <li class="text">Check the heating element for any damage. If the heating element is visibly cracked or broken, replace it with a new one.</li>
