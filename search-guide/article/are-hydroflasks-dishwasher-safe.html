                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-3">What materials are dishwasher safe and why to avoid others?</h2>
                    <p class="text">When tackling any household cleaning task, a dishwasher is an invaluable tool used to help quickly and efficiently clean dishes. </p>
                    <p class="text"> But it's important to be mindful of what materials can withstand the dishwasher and which should be avoided. The materials that are dishwasher safe typically have certain characteristics like durability and heat resistance that make them suitable for the process.</p>
                    <p class="text"> Here is a list of what materials are considered dishwasher safe and why avoiding others is important:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Plastic: Plastic is dishwasher friendly because it has the ability to withstand extreme heat and it is also very durable.</li>
                            <li class="text">Glass: Glass is a good option for the dishwasher because it can survive the heat and can also be washed with heavy pressure. Be sure to use tempered glass to ensure it wonât break or crack under intense pressure.</li>
                            <li class="text">Metal: Stainless steel is a great option for the dishwasher since it is very durable and can withstand the high-temperature cleaning process. It is best to avoid aluminum and other metals because they can rust.</li>
                            <li class="text">Ceramics and Porcelain: Both of these materials are excellent options for the dishwasher since they can withstand heat and are highly durable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">However, it is important to avoid placing certain materials in the dishwasher.</p>
                    <p class="text">Wood is not suitable because it can be damaged by the heat of the dishwasher. </p>
                    <p class="text">Similarly, some plastics, like Tupperware, can also be weakened by the heat and could potentially melt. Stone, like marble or granite should not be put in the dishwasher either, as it is too delicate and can easily crack.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">A food-safe plastic interior coating: This protective coating helps prevent staining and other damage from dishwashing and eliminates the need for preservative chemicals.</li>
                            <li class="text">Vacuum insulation: This technology helps prevent heat transfer, so even warm drinks stay cold or hot drinks stay warm for longer. It also helps protect the interior from damage from dishwashing.</li>
                            <li class="text">A silicone lid: This provides an extra layer of protection between the bottle and the lid, making it easier to clean.</li>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-5">How to properly load HydroFlasks in a dishwasher?</h2>
                    <p class="text">If youâre looking for an effective and easy way to clean your HydroFlasks, a dishwasher is an ideal solution.</p>
                    <p class="text">However, loading a HydroFlask into a dishwasher requires some care and attention to ensure that your bottles are cleaned properly, without any damage. </p>
                    <p class="text">Here are our top tips to effectively and safely load HydroFlasks in a dishwasher:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Place the HydroFlasks onto the top or lower rack of your dishwasher â make sure they are arranged to give the water maximum contact with the bottles, taking care to not crowd or overlap any of the bottles.</li>
                            <li class="text">Place the HydroFlask lids into the silverware basket â the fins and surface of the lids is especially prone to becoming damaged in a dishwasher, so keeping them separate and securing them in the basket will help to protect them.</li>
                            <li class="text">Set the cycle to a shorter duration â shorter cycles are less aggressive and therefore less likely to cause any damage to your HydroFlask.</li>
                            <li class="text">Use the lightest setting possible â this helps to reduce any agitation that may damage the HydroFlask during the cycle.</li>
                            <li class="text">If possible, turn off the pre-wash cycle and the dry cycle â these can both contribute to the amount of wear and tear on a HydroFlask during the dishwasher cycle.</li>
                            <li class="text">Take the HydroFlasks out as soon as the cycle has finished â leaving the bottles in the hot and damp environment of the dishwasher for too long can cause damage, so make sure to empty the dishwasher as soon as the cycle has finished.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                            <li class="text">Check the provided label: Manufacturers typically indicate whether or not a HydroFlask is dishwasher safe on the provided label. As long as itâs clearly stated on the label that the HydroFlask can be safely washed in the dishwasher, then youâre free to proceed.</li>
                            <li class="text">Look for a seal on the lid: HydroFlasks that can be safely washed in a dishwasher will have a special seal on the lid that acts as a water barrier. If there is no seal on the lid, then it is not safe to wash in a dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Check the material: Some HydroFlasks are made with metal or aluminum and not plastic, so they will not be able to take the heat or the powerful detergents used in dishwashers. If the HydroFlask is metal or aluminum, then it is not dishwasher safe.</li>
                            <li class="text">Read customer reviews: If youâre still not sure whether or not your HydroFlask is dishwasher safe, you can always read customer reviews to see if anyone has reported any issues with their HydroFlask in the dishwasher.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-7">What makes a product dishwasher safe?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Being able to safely and effectively wash our dishes in a dishwasher is an essential amenity in many modern households. </p>
                    <p class="text">To ensure a product can withstand the harsh environment of a dishwasher, there are certain characteristics and factors that must be considered.</p>
                    <p class="text"> Below is a list of what makes a product dishwasher safe:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Water and soap resistance: Dishwashers use hot, soapy water to clean items, so a dishwasher-safe product must be able to withstand this environment and not be damaged, corroded or stained by the water and soap.</li>
                            <li class="text">Heat tolerance: Dishwashers use hot water to clean and sterilize items, so a dishwasher-safe product must be able to withstand the intensity of the heat without warping or melting.</li>

                            <li class="text">Chemical resistance: Many dishwasher detergents contain strong chemicals and bleaching agents which can damage certain materials. Dishwasher-safe products must be able to resist these chemical agents.</li>
                            <li class="text">Non-absorbency: Dishwashers use water to clean, so a dishwasher-safe product must be non-absorbent and not retain any water or moisture, otherwise it can cause rust or other surface discoloration.</li>
                            <li class="text">Size and shape: Choose a dishwasher-safe product that is appropriately sized and shaped to be safe in a dishwasher. Smaller items should fit into the racks and larger items should rest safely on the surface of the bottom rack.</li>

                    <p class="text"> Below we explore five alternatives to consider when cleaning a HydroFlask and compare their effectiveness to the traditional method of dishwasher cleaning.</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Boiling Water â Boiling water is a great alternative to cleaning a HydroFlask. Fill the bottle with water, bring to a boil, and then let it stand for a few minutes. Once the water has cooled down you can thoroughly rinse out the HydroFlask and air dry.</li>
                            <li class="text">Baking Soda and Water â Make a paste with baking soda and water and use a brush or sponge to scrub the inside of the HydroFlask. Rinse out the paste with fresh water and air dry.</li>
                            <li class="text">Vinegar and Water â Fill theHydroFlask with a solution of vinegar and water and let it sit for at least an hour. Rinse out the mixture with fresh water and air dry.</li>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-12">What are the Safety issues with cleaning HydroFlasks in a dishwasher?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Properly caring for and cleaning HydroFlasks is important for hygiene and longevity.</p>
                    <p class="text">However, it is important to consider various safety issues before putting HydroFlasks in a dishwasher. </p>
                    <p class="text">Here is a list of safety considerations for cleaning HydroFlasks in a dishwasher:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text"> Heat: High temperatures can cause Stainless steel HydroFlasks to warp and the seal to weaken over time.</li>
                            <li class="text">Detergents: While it is safe to use a mild dishwashing detergent, the concentrated chemicals can cause damage to the HydroFlask seal if it isn't thoroughly rinsed afterward.</li>
                            <li class="text">Sanitization: While it is possible to achieve sanitization in a dishwasher, the use of dishwasher detergents may not be strong enough to properly kill viruses or bacteria.</li>
                            <li class="text">Pressure: HydroFlask tops are not designed to withstand the pressure of a powerful dishwasher cycle. This could cause the top of the HydroFlask to come off or break easily.</li>
                            <li class="text">Scratches: HydroFlasks are made of Stainless Steel and while they are durable, they can become scratched in the dishwasher. This could cause them to look worn and tarnished over time.</li>
                            <li class="text">Rusting: HydroFlasks are not rust-proof and can be susceptible to rusting when placed in a dishwasher.</li>
