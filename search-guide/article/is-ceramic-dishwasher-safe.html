                    <p class="text">To make sure your dishwasher runs optimally and your dishes don't get damaged, check out this overview of materials that are dishwasher safe and details on why to avoid using certain materials.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here's what you need to know:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <p class="text"> Dishwasher safe materials typically include stainless steel, aluminum, plastic, glazed ceramics, melamine, and glass.</p>
                        <p class="text"> For these materials, the high-temperature water and strong detergents used in the dishwasher won’t cause any damage. Some heat-resistant metals are also suitable, such as cast iron and enamelware. </p>
                        <p class="text text-alt"> On the other hand, there are materials that are not suitable for use in the dishwasher. These include materials that may stain easily, such as copper, brass, and china, as well as materials that may warp or breakdown in the high-temperature water and detergents, such as wooden utensils and hand-painted or decorative items. </p>
                        <p class="text"> Uncoated aluminum or nonstick cookware should also be avoided, as the dishwasher can greatly reduce the effectiveness of the nonstick coating. </p>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-4">Ceramic materials and features:</h2>
                    <p class="text">When selecting dishes made from ceramic, it’s important to understand which materials and features will make them safe to use in the dishwasher.</p>
                    <p class="text"> To help make your decision a little easier, here’s a list of the most common materials and features found in ceramic dishes that make them dishwasher safe:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text"> Porcelain or stoneware- Porcelain or stoneware is usually the safest choice for ceramic dishes. Its low porosity and density make it incredibly resistant to staining and extreme temperatures.</li>
                            <li class="text"> Glazed surface- Many dishes are glazed with a non-porous material, such as glass. This helps create an especially smooth surface which is waterproof, making it safe to use in the dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Durability- Look for ceramic dishes that are made with strong and durable material, such as stoneware, which will better stand up to the harsher temperatures and detergents used in the dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Quality of paint- If there’s paint on the ceramic dishes, make sure it’s of high quality. Low-quality paint can easily chip off in the dishwasher, potentially releasing dangerous toxins into your food and drink.</li>
                            <li class="text">Hand-washing instructions- Before using a ceramic dish in the dishwasher, read the hand-washing instructions carefully. Many ceramic dishes come with instructions that recommend hand-washing only, so be sure to follow them to protect the dish from damage or deterioration.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-5">How to properly load Ceramic in a dishwasher?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Cleaning ceramic dishes effectively and safely in the dishwasher can be tricky.</p>
                    <p class="text">To make sure you get the job done right, it's important to know how to properly load your ceramic dishes.</p>
                    <p class="text"> Here's a step-by-step guide to loading ceramic dishes in the dishwasher:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Always start with the cleanest dishes – The dirtier dishes can be washed on a lower temperature setting. Make sure dishes are placed on the top and bottom racks with the dirtiest faces pointing down so they can get the right amount of water and ensure the ceramic is properly cleaned.</li>
                            <li class="text">Don't use too much detergent – Detergent that has built up can cause residue on your ceramic dishes and leave them cloudy. Use the manufacturer's suggested amount and avoid adding extra.</li>
                            <li class="text"> Avoid overcrowding – When stacking dishes, make sure that air is allowed to circulate freely. Too many dishes in the dishwasher will block water from evenly distributing.</li>
                            <li class="text">Choose the right cycle – Use a light cycle for less heavily soiled dishes or the heavy-duty cycle for heavily soiled items like pans and pots with baked-on grease.</li>
                            <li class="text">Look for special washes – Special washes are designed specifically for ceramic dishes and can help prevent staining and discoloring.</li>
                            <li class="text">Remove dishes as soon as the cycle is over – Allow the ceramic dishes to cool before handling and quickly unload the dishwasher as soon as the cycle is over to minimize any drying.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">Following these simple steps, your ceramic dishes should come out of the dishwasher sparkling clean. Enjoy!</p>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-6">How to know if Ceramic is dishwasher safe?</h2>
                    <p class="text">When using a ceramic dish or cup, you may wonder if it is safe to wash in the dishwasher.</p>
                    <p class="text"> While some ceramic items are safe to wash in the dishwasher, others are not. </p>
                    <p class="text">Following these tips and checking the below points will help you figure out if the ceramic item you have is dishwasher-safe.</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Check for markings – Most dishwasher-safe ceramic items will have a corresponding marking or label. Look for a symbol that resembles a plate with a stroke of water above it. If this marking is present, the ceramic is considered dishwasher-safe.</li>
                            <li class="text">Examine the glaze – Some ceramic items may have a glaze on them. This glaze can affect the durability and potentially the dishwasher-safe rating of the ceramic item. Look for signs of wear on the surface of the glaze, as damage to the glaze can increase the chances that the ceramic is not dishwasher safe.</li>
                            <li class="text">Ask an expert – If you are unsure if a piece of ceramic is dishwasher safe, you may want to consult an expert in the field. With their knowledge, they can provide you with a definitive answer as to the dishwasher-safe status of the piece.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-7">What makes a product dishwasher safe?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Dishwasher-safe products are designed to withstand the heat, cleaning detergent, and hours of washing and rinsing in a dishwasher.</p>
                    <p class="text">To be deemed dishwasher safe, a product should be durable, able to withstand high temperatures and harsh detergents, and resistant to fading and discoloration.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are a few of the characteristics that make a product dishwasher-safe:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Durability: Choose materials made from high-grade, heat-resistant plastics like polycarbonate, polyphenylene oxide, polypropylene, polysulfone, and polyester.</li>
                            <li class="text"> Resistance to Chemicals: The product should be able to stand up to harsh detergents and other soaps, such as chlorine and bleach, typically used in a dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Temperature Tolerance: The product must not soften or expand when exposed to hot water.</li>
                            <li class="text">Corrosion Resistance: The material should be resistant to chipping, dulling, and oxidation due to exposure to moisture or detergents.</li>
                            <li class="text"> Color: Lighter colors or those that have been pre-treated tend to resist fading due to multiple dishwasher cycles.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-8">Alternatives to dishwasher cleaning for Ceramic:</h2>
                    <p class="text">Even though a dishwasher is the quickest and most effective way to clean ceramic, there are some alternative cleaning methods that you can use as an alternative. </p>
                    <p class="text">Check out this list below to see how these alternatives compare to dishwasher cleaning and decide which method works best for you:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Hot Water & Detergent: fill a sink or basin with hot water and some dishwashing detergent to create a cleaning solution. Washing the dishes by hand in the solution with a clean brush will remove dirt, grease, and food debris.</li>
                            <li class="text">Baking Soda & Vinegar: create a paste with baking soda and vinegar to scrub away any dirt and grime.</li>
                            <li class="text">Non-Abrasive Cleaners: use non-abrasive cleaners like Bon Ami or Oxyclean to scrub away any dirt or build up. Make sure to use a soft cloth to avoid scratching the ceramic.</li>
                            <li class="text">Rubbing Alcohol & Water: this is one of the most effective ways to clean ceramic, but you should always test a small area first. Mix equal parts rubbing alcohol and water and apply it to the ceramic surface with a cotton ball.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">Each of these alternatives can be effective for cleaning ceramic, but it is always best to use a dishwasher as it is more powerful and efficient. </p>

                    <p class="text">Cleaning ceramic in a dishwasher can be a convenient and efficient way to clean household dishes.</p>
                    <p class="text">However, before deciding to utilize this option, it’s important to consider the safety risks involved. </p>
                    <p class="text">Here's a list of the main safety issues to consider when cleaning ceramic in a dishwasher:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Dishware Should Be Labeled Dishwasher Safe. Ceramic dishes may crack or chip in the dishwasher, resulting in sharp pieces of broken glass and a hazardous cleaning environment. To avoid this, look for dishes that are specifically labeled as “dishwasher safe” before washing.</li>
                            <li class="text">Avoid Extreme Temperatures. High temperatures can cause cracking in ceramic dishes. To keep the dishes safe and in tact, use the dishwasher’s lower temperature setting.</li>
                            <li class="text">Keep the Dishes Separate. Avoid putting ceramic dishes too close together in the dishwasher to prevent them from bumping and cracking each other.</li>
                            <li class="text">Clean Gently. When washing ceramic dishes in the dishwasher, use a gentle setting to prevent scratches from forming on the surfaces.</li>
                            <li class="text">Monitor the Rinse Cycle. Once the washing is done, keep an eye on the rinse cycle to ensure that the dishes are not left to soak in hot water for too long. This can lead to warping or cracking.</li>
                        </ul>
