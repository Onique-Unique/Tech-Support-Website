                    <p class="text">Cleaning dishes can be a chore, but investing in the right materials can ease the burden.</p>
                    <p class="text">Creating a kitchen comprised of dishwasher-safe materials is essential for any busy household looking for a little extra time-saving help.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here's what you need to know about materials that are safe to put in a dishwasher, and why avoiding certain items can be beneficial:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Ceramics: Ceramic is an excellent choice for dishes and cookware because it is incredibly durable and resistant to heat and water. It can also handle large temperature swings, so you don't need to worry about putting hot items in the dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Stainless steel: Stainless steel is another top choice due to its durability and resistance to corrosion. It can handle high temperatures and is often dishwasher-safe.</li>
                            <li class="text">Plastic: Plastic is a great choice for a variety of kitchen items, including dishes and utensils. Look for a plastic that is labeled "dishwasher-safe," as some plastics will not be able to handle the heat.</li>
                            <li class="text">Wooden items: Wooden items like cutting boards and spoons should not be put in the dishwasher. The intense heat and steam can damage the wood, leaving it warped and cracked.</li>
                            <li class="text">Gold-plated items: Gold-plated items can tarnish in a dishwasher, so it's best to avoid cleaning them in that manner.</li>
                            <li class="text">Non-stick items: Non-stick items like pans and skillets should also be avoided. The heat and water can damage the non-stick coating, leaving them at risk of rusting and flaking.</li>
                            <li class="text">Cast iron: Cast iron cookware should never be placed in a dishwasher as the intense heat can damage the pan.</li>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-7">What makes a product dishwasher safe?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Often times, when selecting items for your kitchen, you'll want to make sure they're dishwasher safe. Before adding them to your dishwasher, it's important to consider whether the product you're selecting is truly designed to withstand the intense heat, and powerful detergent, of a dishwasher. </p>
                    <p class="text">There are certain characteristics that make a product dishwasher safe, such as high heat and chemical resistance, waterproof material construction, and non-corrosive components.</p>
                    <p class="text">Read on to learn more about what makes a product dishwasher safe:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">High Heat and Chemical Resistance: A product that has properties that will not corrode, degrade or discolor when exposed to high heat and dishwashing detergents, is dishwasher safe.</li>
                            <li class="text">Waterproof Material Construction: For items to be considered safe for a dishwasher, they must have waterproof material, such as plastics, ceramic, and stainless steel, as these materials are not affected by water, detergent, or heat.</li>
                            <li class="text"> Non-Corrosive Components: Products made out of metals such as aluminum, copper, and brass, can all be negatively affected by the heat and detergent of a dishwasher. To prevent corroding and staining, it’s important to choose components that are resistant to corrosion.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-8">Alternatives to dishwasher cleaning for Ninja Blender:</h2>
                    <p class="text">Are you looking for alternatives to dishwasher cleaning for your Ninja Blender? If so, you are in the right place! </p>
                    <p class="text"> While many people assume that dishwasher cleaning should always be the best option for cleaning their blenders, there are actually several other methods of cleaning that can be just as effective.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here is a list of some of the best alternatives to dishwasher cleaning for your Ninja Blender, as well as how they compare to dishwasher cleaning:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Soaking: Soaking your Ninja Blender in warm, soapy water for 30 minutes is a great way to remove any caked-on food residue. This method is just as effective as dishwasher cleaning, but may take a little longer.</li>
                            <li class="text">Manual Washing: Manual washing is the most common and popular alternative to dishwasher cleaning for Ninja Blenders. Many blenders come with a separate brush for manual cleaning, making it easy to get into hard to reach places and quickly remove food residue.</li>
                            <li class="text">Vinegar Soak: A vinegar soak can help to disinfect and remove any lingering odors from your Ninja Blender. To do this, simply add one cup of distilled white vinegar to the blender and let it soak for several minutes. Rinse with warm, soapy water afterwards.</li>
                            <li class="text"> Steam Cleaning: Steam cleaning is great for disinfecting and removing dirt and debris quickly and easily. To use this method, fill a pot of water and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, turn off the heat and place the Ninja Blender's removable parts into the pot and cover. Let sit for 15 minutes, then rinse each piece with warm water.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-9">How to care and maintain Ninja Blender after dishwasher cleaning?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Caring for and maintaining a Ninja Blender after cleaning it in a dishwasher is an important step in keeping them in good condition and extending their useful life.</p>
                    <p class="text">Although many Ninja Blenders are dishwasher-safe, proper care and maintenance post-cleaning are essential for keeping them in top shape.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are some tips on how to care for and maintain your Ninja Blender after a dishwasher cleaning:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Dry Parts Thoroughly – After removing the blades, lid and other removable parts from the dishwasher, dry them thoroughly with a clean cloth. This removes any remaining traces of water, soap and food residue that could lead to damage or spoilage of the blender parts.</li>
                            <li class="text">Inspect Parts & Make Repairs – Give each part a thorough once-over to make sure nothing is damaged or missing and that all screws, hinges and latches are in place and secure. If you do find any damage, you may be able to make the necessary repairs yourself or contact Ninja Blender customer service for assistance.</li>
                            <li class="text">Store Properly – Make sure to properly store each part of your Ninja Blender individually for added protection and longevity. Place the blades in their own container or in a drawer or cabinet away from the dishwasher. Stack the removable parts, ensuring that they are not jammed together as this can cause them to become damaged during transport.</li>
                            <li class="text">Clean Regularly – After every use, rinse off your Ninja Blender with warm, soapy water and dry with a clean cloth. Avoid using harsh dishwashing detergents or abrasive cleansers that may damage the surface of the blender.</li>
