                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-7">What makes a product dishwasher safe?</h2>
                    <p class="text">While there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to making a product dishwasher safe, there are certain characteristics and considerations that must be taken in order to ensure your dishes come out clean and unharmed.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here is a list of what makes a product dishwasher safe:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Resistant Material â Items that are safe to put in the dishwasher must be made from materials that are able to withstand extreme temperatures and heavy water pressure. This includes items like stainless steel, tempered glass, ceramic, and plastic.</li>
                            <li class="text">Heat and Pressure â Items that are safe to place in the dishwasher must be able to hold up to both high temperatures and water pressure. Any item made with a soft material such as a rubber seal or wax finish should not ever be placed in a dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Dishwasher Safe Labels â As a general rule, it is always best to check the label of any item that is being placed in a dishwasher to make sure it is officially labeled as âdishwasher safe.â If there is no mention of being dishwasher safe on the label, do not place the item in the dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Removal of Heavy Residue â If the item contains a heavy residue, such as a greasy residue, it should be pre-cleaned prior to being placed into the dishwasher for cleaning. This will ensure that the food particles and oils do not interfere with the cleaning process, as excessive buildup can damage the dishwasher itself.</li>
                            <li class="text">Appropriate Placement â To reduce the risk of any items cracking or breaking, items should be placed in an appropriate position in the dishwasher. This will ensure full contact with the water jet and hot air that is used in the dishwashing process.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">By following these guidelines, you can successfully and safely deliver clean dishes in the dishwasher on a regular basis.</p>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-8">Alternatives to dishwasher cleaning for Tupperware:</h2>
                    <p class="text">A dishwasher is often the simplest, fastest way to clean Tupperware.</p>
                    <p class="text">However, there are a number of alternative methods that can be used to effectively and safely clean Tupperware. </p>
                    <p class="text">Outlined below are some of the most common alternatives to dishwasher cleaning for Tupperware, along with a comparison of their effectiveness:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Handwashing: One of the most widely used alternatives to dishwasher cleaning for Tupperware is handwashing. Using a quality dish soap and a sponge or cloth, handwashing is incredibly effective and is the least aggressive cleaning method, meaning it is safest for your Tupperware.</li>
                            <li class="text">Boiling: A more time consuming but often effective way to clean Tupperware is through boiling. Boiling Tupperware items such as containers, lids, and utensils in a pot of water is a great way to get rid of bacteria and food particles.</li>
                            <li class="text">Vinegar Soak: Soaking Tupperware items in a solution of equal parts vinegar and water is a great way to remove stubborn food particles, stains, and odors. Soaking in this solution for at least 15 minutes can help remove residue.</li>
                            <li class="text">Baking Soda Soak: A baking soda soak is a great alternative for a more natural clean. Adding Â¼ cup of baking soda per quart of water and soaking in the solution for at least 15 minutes can help remove stubborn soils and help eliminate bad odors.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">When comparing these alternatives to dishwasher cleaning for Tupperware, handwashing is the least aggressive but most time consuming, while boiling and soaking are more aggressive methods but are much faster.</p>
                    <p class="text">Ultimately, it depends on the level of cleaning required and the amount of time youâre willing to invest.</p>

                    <p class="text">Here are some tips to help you do just that:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Dry Thoroughly â Always take the time to thoroughly dry all Tupperware items before storing them. This prevents any water droplets from damaging the plastic.</li>

                            <li class="text">Use Soft Sponges and Cloths- When washing Tupperware in the sink, itâs best to use softer sponges and cloths. This decreases the chance of scratches, discoloration, and uneven surfaces.</li>
                            <li class="text">Immediately Repair any Damage - Any damage such as chips, cracks and scratches should be repaired as soon as you notice them. This maintains the overall quality of the plastic and prevents the damage from worsening.</li>
                            <li class="text">Donât Microwave any Metalware - Any metalware or pieces with metal components should not be microwaved. This can cause melting and discoloration in the material.</li>
