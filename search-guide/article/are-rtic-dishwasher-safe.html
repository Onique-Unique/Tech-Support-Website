                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-7"> What materials are dishwasher safe and why to avoid others?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Dishwashers are an essential part of our daily lives as they are useful in quickly, easily, and efficiently cleaning our dishes and utensils.</p>
                    <p class="text">Knowing which materials are safe to put in the dishwasher is key to avoiding damage and optimizing the cleaning process.</p>
                    <p class="text">To help determine which materials are safe and which to avoid, here are the characteristics that make a material dishwasher safe and why to avoid certain materials:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Materials such as metal, glass, plastic, and ceramic are generally considered dishwasher safe because they have strong durability and heat resistance. </li>
                            <li class="text"> Metal is particularly resistant to corrosion, making it safe to be cleaned without harsh chemicals.</li>
                            <li class="text">Glass is also dishwasher safe and its heat resistance makes it suitable for a wash with hot water. </li>
                            <li class="text">Plastic is also typically dishwasher safe as most of them can withstand high temperatures and heavy pressure. </li>
                            <li class="text">Ceramic is also a popular choice for dishwasher safe as it has strong durability and is a tough material.</li>
                            <li class="text">Materials such as wood and rubber should be avoided in the dishwasher because they are not heat resistant and can be ruined by the combination of high temperature and moisture. </li>
                            <li class="text">They can also be damaged by harsh detergents or the powerful jets of a dishwasher. Similarly, delicate materials such as fine china, crystal, and silver should be avoided in the dishwasher as they could be damaged by intense heat and moisture as well.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                            <li class="text">Pre-rinse â Before you place any RTIC product in the dishwasher, make sure to pre-rinse them using soap and water to remove excess dirt and debris.</li>

Also, donât overfill the dishwasher and leave adequate space between the items when stacking them.</li>
                            <li class="text">Keep snacks and foods away â Donât put snacks or food items directly in the dishwasher or in the same compartment as the RTIC products, as the food bits might gum up the filters or the drainage system.</li>
                            <li class="text"> Remove labels and covers â When loading RTIC containers or other RTIC food items into the dishwasher, make sure to remove any labels or covers as these can melt or warp when exposed to high heat.</li>
                            <li class="text"> Use the correct setting â For RTIC products and bottles, use the âLight Washâ or âNormal Washâ setting depending on the products. However, if you have RTIC stainless steel mugs or bottles, you can use the âHeavy Washâ setting.</li>
                            <li class="text">Check regularly â If thereâs any debris or food residue in the dishwasher after the cycle is complete, just run it on a short cycle until clean.</li>

                    <p class="text">Are you looking to know if RTIC Products are dishwasher safe? If so, you're in luck. This guide provides tips and information you can use to determine if RTIC products can safely be washed in a dishwasher.</p>
                    <p class="text">Weâve listed out the points that you can look for and provided specific tips to identify if RTIC Products are dishwasher-safe.</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Look for the dishwasher safe icon or words. RTIC specifically states if items are suitable for washing in a dishwasher. Keeping this in mind, look for either the icon or lettering that indicate that the product is dishwasher-safe. This can usually be found on the package, online or printed on the product itself.</li>
                            <li class="text">Check the care instructions. Be sure to also look out for the care instructions associated with various RTIC Products. Depending on the type of product and its material, a specific dishwasher-safe setting may be required.</li>
                            <li class="text"> Look at the product material. Some materials may be dishwasher safe by default. However, it's always a good idea to double-check the material type and make sure it's suitable for a dishwasher. Soft and hard plastic items are usually suitable for washing, while items made of metal or wood should not be put in a dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Pay attention to the product shape. If an RTIC Product is made of a dishwasher-safe material, take a closer look at its shape. Certain shapes may interfere with the dishwasherâs rotation and other settings, resulting in an inefficient clean.</li>
                            <li class="text">Check for attachments that should not be put in a dishwasher. Some RTIC Products may have extra parts or attachments that should be cleaned separately. Make sure these parts and pieces are marked as hand wash only.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
