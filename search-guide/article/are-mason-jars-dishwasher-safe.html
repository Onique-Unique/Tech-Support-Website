                            <li class="text">Paper items like napkins, disposable tablecloths, or even paper plates should also not be placed in the dishwasher, as they will become soggy and possibly disintegrate.</li>

                    <p class="text">Here’s a list of effective ways to ensure that your Mason Jar is sparkling clean without relying on a dishwasher:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Soak your Mason Jar in warm water and soap: Soaking your Mason Jar in a sink or basin filled with warm water and soap is an effective way of cleaning the jar. Leave it to sit and the soap will gently loosen any dirt or residue stuck on the jar.</li>
                            <li class="text">Use a cleaning brush: You can use a soft brush such as a toothbrush to get into the hard to reach areas. This works especially well if your Mason Jar has grooves or raised designs as the bristles can easily fit into the crevices.</li>
                            <li class="text">Use white distilled vinegar: For tough, stubborn stains, using white distilled vinegar can help to break down the grime. To use, simply fill your Mason Jar half-way with vinegar and hot water and let it sit for at least 10 minutes. Then, rinse it with clean, hot water and it should be good as new!</li>
                            <li class="text">Use baking soda: Many people swear by baking soda as it’s a great natural cleaning agent. To use, mix a tablespoon of baking soda into warm water and stir until it's dissolved. Then, use a cloth to rub away any dirt or grime.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-12">What are the Safety issues with cleaning Mason Jar in a dishwasher?</h2>
                    <p class="text">When it comes to cleaning your Mason Jar in a dishwasher, there are a few safety issues to be aware of before getting started.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here is a list of important considerations to keep in mind when using the dishwasher to clean your Mason Jars:
                    </p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Mason Jars can be easily warped or broken in a dishwasher, especially when they are made of glass. To avoid this, it is best to use plastic or metal Mason Jars to prevent damage.</li>
                            <li class="text">Make sure you don't place metal lids in the dishwasher. Metal lids are prone to rust when metal reacts with water, food, and detergent in the dishwasher. Rusting metal will leave a discoloration on your Mason Jar and could also damage your dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Narrow-necked Mason Jars can be more difficult to clean in the dishwasher. This is because the narrow neck can be difficult for the water and detergent to get into and clean the neck of the jar.</li>
                            <li class="text">Be sure to place your Mason Jars on the top rack of the dishwasher. This will help to prevent the jars from being exposed to the high heat generated by the jets at the bottom of the dishwasher.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">By following these simple guidelines, you can safely and efficiently clean your Mason Jars in the dishwasher and enjoy them for years to come.</p>
