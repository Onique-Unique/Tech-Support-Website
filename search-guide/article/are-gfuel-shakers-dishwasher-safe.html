                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-7">What makes a product dishwasher safe?</h2>
                    <p class="text">When purchasing a product, itâs important to consider whether it is dishwasher safe or not.</p>
                    <p class="text"> Even though products are labeled as âdishwasher safeâ it doesnât automatically mean that itâs safe for all dishwashers.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are some characteristics to consider when determining whether a product can be safely washed in a dishwasher:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Resistance to Heat: Heat is one of the primary elements in a dishwasher as it is what helps kill bacteria, breaks down grease and food particles and helps clean dishes. If a product canât withstand the temperatures inside a dishwasher, it will be damaged.</li>
                            <li class="text">Resistance to Detergents: Many detergents contain chemicals that can damage certain materials. This is especially true for wooden utensils, cloth products and products with painted surfaces. If a product is not resistant to detergents, it could become damaged during the washing cycle.</li>
                            <li class="text">Ability to Drain Water: Dishwashers drain water at a very high pressure, which can be too powerful for some materials. If a product cannot withstand this pressure, it could cause damage to the product or the dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Material of the Product: Certain materials are not suitable for dishwashers as they can cause scratches to the surfaces of dishes or become damaged in the process. For example, wooden or plastic utensils can easily become damaged in a dishwasher and should be washed by hand.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">By considering these characteristics and factors, you can determine if a product is able to be safely washed in the dishwasher.</p>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-8">Alternatives to dishwasher cleaning for GFUEL Shaker:</h2>
                    <p class="text">Are you looking for a viable alternative to traditional dishwasher cleaning for your GFUEL Shaker?</p>
                    <p class="text">Here's a list we've compiled of ways that you can clean your GFUEL Shaker while maintaining the same level of hygiene and safety.</p>
                    <p class="text">All of these methods are just as effective as dishwashing but come with their own set of advantages and disadvantages.</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Hand Washing: One of the most traditional methods involves washing your GFUEL shaker with a combination of warm water and a mild soap. This method requires more time, effort, and physical labor but is quite safe and convenient. You'll have to remember to properly rinse off your shaker to avoid unwanted residue.</li>
                            <li class="text">Boiling Water: Another popular method is to boil your shaker for about 5 minutes in a pot of water on your stove. This should help to break down any residue and left over messes from the inside of your shaker. While boiling your shaker takes less time and effort, it can also present a safety hazard if you don't maintain the boiling temperature.</li>
                            <li class="text">Vinegar Soaking: This approach entails soaking your GFUEL shaker in a bath of white vinegar for about 15 minutes. This method can be very effective in cutting through any residue and helping to break it down smoothly. The downside to this method is that your shaker may not be as desired smelling afterwards due to the vinegar.</li>
                            <li class="text">Disinfectant Soak: Soaking your shaker in a bath of disinfectant is another way to maintain the inside of your GFUEL shaker and make it shine. This method requires you to use a sufficient amount of a disinfectant but, once you remember to rinse everything off properly, should be as effective as any of the above methods.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">The great thing about all of these methods is that they are all just as effective as dishwashing and can provide the same level of hygiene and safety.</p>
                    <p class="text">So, whatever method you choose, make sure that you remember to properly rinse off your GFUEL Shaker afterwards.</p>
