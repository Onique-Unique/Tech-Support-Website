                            <li class="text">Vinegar and Baking Soda: Make a paste of white vinegar and baking soda, spread it over the grates, and let it sit to break down the dirt. After a few minutes, scrub the grates with a damp cloth or brush and rinse with water.</li>
                            <li class="text">Ammonia: Ammonia is a great alternative to harsh chemical cleaners for this job. Fill a bucket with about a gallon of water and add 1 cup of ammonia. Soak the grates in the ammonia solution for a few hours and then scrub them with a brush.</li>
                            <li class="text">Baking Soda: Simple baking has a natural abrasive power, so making a paste with it and water can help to loosen and break down dirt and debris on stove grates.
