                    <p class="text">Do you want to load your dishwasher with containers and cookware but wonder which ones can be safely cleaned in a dishwasher?</p>
                    <p class="text">Not all materials are suitable for dishwasher cleaning, so it's important to know what materials are dishwasher safe and why some should be avoided.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here are some tips to help you determine which materials are safe to put in your dishwasher, and which you should avoid:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <p class="text"> Some materials are heat resistant and durable enough to be safely washed in a dishwasher. These materials are typically glass, ceramic, porcelain, silver, stainless steel, and plastic. </p>
                        <p class="text"> These materials can usually handle the high temperatures of a dishwasher as well as the detergent and moisture. </p>
                        <p class="text text-alt"> On the other hand, there are also materials that are not suitable for use in a dishwasher. These materials usually do not possess the heat resistance or durability to withstand the dishwasher's temperature and pressure. </p>
                        <p class="text"> These include wooden utensils, some teapots, and fine china. These should be hand-washed with a soft detergent to help preserve them and keep them from cracking due to the heat. </p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">For safety and longevity, it's important to ensure that you are only putting dishwasher-safe materials in your dishwasher.</p>
                    <p class="text">Doing so will help keep your dishes, utensils, and cookware in good condition for years to come!</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Always ensure that the Brumate Bottle is completely dry before loading it in the dishwasher. Condensation can cause water spots or discolouration.</li>
                            <li class="text">Place the Brumate Bottle on the top rack in the dishwasher. This allows the water to flow freely through the bottle and get rid of tough stains.</li>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-6">How to know if Brumate Bottle is dishwasher safe?</h2>
                    <p class="text">Are you wondering if your Brumate Bottle is safe to put in the dishwasher?</p>
                    <p class="text">Great question! If you’re investing in a Brumate Bottle, you want to make sure it is durable, and one way of ensuring it remains in good condition is making sure you keep it clean.</p>
                    <p class="text">How to tell if your Brumate bottle is dishwasher safe, as well as some tips to keep your bottle in good condition:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Check the label on the bottle: Most bottles will list the materials they are made out of which can often determine if you can put it in the dishwasher. For instance, some Brumate Bottles are made with a combination of stainless steel and plastic, and can be safely put in the dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Examine the lid: If the lid is made of plastic, you should avoid putting it in the dishwasher. The hot water and steam can cause the plastic to warp and not fit back onto your bottle properly.</li>
                            <li class="text">Test the bottle before you put it in the dishwasher: Put a few drops of water in the bottle and see if it gets hot. If the bottle gets hot, it is probably not dishwasher safe.</li>
                            <li class="text"> Look for any faults in the bottle: If you have an older Brumate Bottle, check the seams and make sure there aren't any cracks or loose parts. The dishwasher could cause pieces to break off and become a choking hazard.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-7">What makes a product dishwasher safe?</h2>
                    <p class="text">When it comes to keeping our dishes clean and looking their best, dishwashers are a must-have appliance.</p>
                    <p class="text">But when choosing products for your kitchen, it's important to make sure that they are safe to use in the dishwasher. </p>
                    <p class="text">Here are the qualities that make a product dishwasher safe so you can confidently choose the best options for your family:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Heat and water resistance: The hot water and steam released by a dishwasher can damage certain materials over time. Look for items made of high heat and water resistant materials such as stainless steel, borosilicate glass, and melamine.</li>
                            <li class="text">Durability: The cooling and expanding processes that happen inside the dishwasher can cause items to become brittle and break. Therefore, make sure to select items that are made of durable, flexible materials such as silicone and rubber.</li>
                            <li class="text">Non-porous: Certain materials are prone to retaining water and becoming stained or rusted. To avoid this, look for non-porous materials such as porcelain or silicone.</li>
                            <li class="text">Design: Some designs and shapes of products may cause them to become stuck during the dishwashing cycle. Therefore, choose items that are close fitting, with minimal gaps and curved edges for easy draining.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-8">Alternatives to dishwasher cleaning for Brumate Bottle:</h2>
                    <p class="text">If dishwasher cleaning isn't an option for maintaining your Brumate Bottle, don't worry! </p>
                    <p class="text">There are plenty of other ways to keep your bottle looking and feeling like new. </p>
                    <p class="text">Here's a list of alternative methods and the benefits of each—it'll help you decide which is best for your bottle and lifestyle:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Soak and Scrub: This is probably the most time-consuming alternative, but it’s sure to get the job done. Fill your Brumate Bottle with hot soapy water and let it soak for at least 15 minutes. Then use a long-handled scrub brush to clean the inside and outside of your bottle.</li>
                            <li class="text">Use Vinegar: Creating a vinegar and water solution will help cut through tough stains and make it easier to scrub stains away. Fill your bottle one-third of the way full with a solution of one part water, one part vinegar. Let it soak for about 30 minutes, then rinse with clean water.</li>
                            <li class="text">Try Baking Soda: Baking soda is a natural cleanser, and it’s great for getting rid of odors and caked-on grime. Mix up equal parts baking soda and water in a bowl, then use a brush or sponge to scrub it inside and outside of your bottle. Rinse well and enjoy a sparkling clean Brumate Bottle!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">Each of these methods is an effective alternative to dishwasher cleaning, but the best choice is ultimately up to you.</p>
                    <p class="text">They differ in amount of time and effort needed, so if you're looking for quick and easy, you may prefer to use vinegar or baking soda.</p>
                    <p class="text"> If you have the time, soaking and scrubbing can be just as effective as a deep clean in the dishwasher.</p>

                            <li class="text">Placing the bottle in a top rack of the dishwasher may cause it to come into contact with sharp edges or other cleaning items that could cause damage or scratching.</li>
                            <li class="text">Using the wrong settings on the dishwasher could lead to a situation where the bottle is not adequately cleaned, leading to the potential for bacteria to remain on the surface.</li>
