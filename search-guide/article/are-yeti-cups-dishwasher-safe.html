                    <p class="text">Cleaning a Yeti Cup in a dishwasher comes with a few safety considerations. </p>

                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Ensure the Cup is Dishwasher Safe: Before placing the cup in the dishwasher, make sure it is dishwasher safe and has not been labeled as âhand wash onlyâ. This is particularly important for Yeti mugs that have a steel and polypropylene liner.</li>
                            <li class="text">Avoid High Heat and Steam Settings: Dishwashers can get extremely hot, which may damage your mug or their liner. Avoid using high heat or steam settings and use shorter cycle cycles as well.</li>
                            <li class="text">Check for Warping: If the Yeti mug has become warped or misshapen after being placed in the dishwasher, discontinue using the dishwasher and hand wash instead.</li>
                            <li class="text">Wash Away Debris Caused by Transferring Mugs: When transferring mugs from the dishwasher to the sink, check the mug and counter top for any debris such as broken glass or plastic that may have become stuck on the mug during cleaning.</li>
                            <li class="text">Avoid Oils and Soaps: To preserve the protective coating of the Yeti mug and enjoy its insulated properties, avoid using oils and soaps when washing. Stick to warm water and a soft cloth or sponge for a thorough and safe clean.</li>
