                    <p class="text">Calphalon is an especially durable cookware range favoured by many home chefs, but how do you identify which pieces are dishwasher safe?</p>
                    <p class="text">To save time and ensure you don't damage your cookware, here are some tips to help you easily identify dishwasher-safe Calphalon cookware:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Look for the markings â nearly all dishwasher-safe Calphalon products display the safe utensils logo, which shows a spatula or spoon raining down over a raised washer symbol. This logo generally appears on the bottom of pots, pans and skillets.</li>
                            <li class="text">Identify the material â while some non-stick cookware manufactured by Calphalon is labeled room temp or hand-wash only, stainless steel and hard anodized cookware generally can go in the dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Read the product information â there's a good chance that any TV commercial, advertisement or packaging you see includes exclusions, warnings and product information, which sometimes includes indications of whether the cookware is dishwasher-safe or not.</li>
                            <li class="text">Consult the manufacturer website â if you need help determining the dishwasher safety of Calphalon cookware, contact customer services or search the website for the product information.</li>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-12">What are the Safety issues with cleaning Calphalon in a dishwasher?</h2>
                    <p class="text">If youâre looking to clean your Calphalon dishes in the dishwasher, itâs important to be aware of the associated safety issues.</p>
                    <p class="text">Here is a handy list of safety points you should consider before you proceed:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Many Calphalon products, such as aluminum pots and pans, are not suitable for dishwashers and can be damaged when subjected to a dishwashing cycleâs high temperatures, as well as its detergents and high pressure jets.</li>
                            <li class="text">Some nonstick Calphalon surfaces canât handle direct water contact and, over time, will lose their nonstick properties if washed in the dishwasher.</li>
                            <li class="text">Covering your Calphalon items with plastic or wood handles can melt in the dishwasher, creating a potentially hazardous situation.</li>
                            <li class="text">Plastic, such as knobs and dials, should be hand-washed and then dried to prevent them from holding water and becoming weakened and potentially dangerous.</li>
                            <li class="text">Glass components, like lids and cookware, can be subjected to thermal shock in the dishwasher and become weakened over time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">Overall, remember to take extra steps if you are planning to wash any Calphalon products in the dishwasher, and carefully read the product's instructions.</p>
