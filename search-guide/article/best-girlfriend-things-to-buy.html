                    <p class="text">There are a few things to avoid when buying for a girlfriend that you should take note of which could help you making mistakes when making purchases: </p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">One is to avoid buying something she would never wear. If she's not into wearing skirts or dresses, then buying her a skirt or dress as a gift is a wasted purchase.</li>
                            <li class="text">Another thing to avoid is buying her something too intimate. This might be something like lingerie, which is a personal item that should be gifted only to someone with whom the giver is already intimate.</li>
                            <li class="text">It's also important to avoid buying her something that's too expensive. Unless you're prepared to spend a lot of money on a gift, it's best to avoid going too high end. </li>
                            <li class="text">There are plenty of other things to choose from that won't break the bank.</li>
                            <li class="text">Ultimately, the best thing to do is to ask the recipient what she would like. This takes the guesswork out of gift buying and ensures that the recipient will be happy with the gift.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">First, think about her interests and what she likes. If you're not sure, ask her friends or family for suggestions but keep it discreet and not too obvious as girls love surprises even though they may say otherwise, but surprises mean that significant other has you on their mind. </li>
                            <li class="text">Second, try to get something that is unique and special. Something that she wouldn't necessarily buy for herself. </li>
                            <li class="text">Finally, make sure the gift is something you're willing to spend a little bit of money on. You don't need to go overboard, but don't skimp on the gift either.</li>
