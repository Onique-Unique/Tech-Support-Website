                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text"> Don't try to do too much at once. When you're starting out, it's best to focus on one or two exercises and do them consistently.</li>
                            <li class="text">Don't use heavy weights. Heavier weights can actually cause you to lose size, because they put too much stress on your muscles.</li>
                            <li class="text">Don't forget to stretch. Stretching can help you increase your range of motion and prevent injuries.</li>
                            <li class="text">Don't overwork your muscles. When you're working out, give your muscles plenty of time to rest and recover.</li>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-4">What are some tips for increasing size? </h2>
                    <p class="text">If you are looking to increase your muscle size, there are a few things you can do to help: </p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">First, make sure you are eating enough protein and calories. </li>
                            <li class="text">Second, make sure you are lifting weights regularly.</li>
                            <li class="text">And third, make sure you are taking a quality muscle-building supplement.</li>
                            <li class="text">When it comes to protein, you should be aiming to eat around 1 gram per pound of body weight. This will help you provide the nutrients your body needs to build muscle. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">In terms of calories, you should be aiming to eat around 20-25 calories per pound of body weight. This will provide you with enough energy to train hard and build muscle.</p>
                    <p class="text">When it comes to lifting weights, you should be lifting heavy weights and doing compound exercises. Compound exercises involve multiple muscle groups, and they are the best exercises for building muscle. Lift heavy weights and do 3-5 sets of 8-10 reps. Rest for 1-2 minutes between sets.</p>
                    <p class="text">When it comes to supplements, you should be taking a quality muscle-building supplement. A good muscle-building supplement will help you increase protein synthesis, build muscle, and reduce muscle breakdown. Look for a supplement that contains a blend of protein, carbs, and creatine.</p>

                        <p class="text"> Some of the best foods to eat for size are eggs, dairy products, and protein-rich foods. Eggs are a great source of protein, as are dairy products like milk and cheese. And protein is essential for muscle growth, so these are all great choices for anyone looking to add size.</p>
                        <p class="text"> In addition to these foods, you should also make sure you’re getting enough carbohydrates. Carbs are the body’s main source of energy, and they’re essential for muscle growth. So make sure you’re eating plenty of rice, pasta, and other carbohydrate-rich foods. </p>
                        <p class="text"> And finally, don’t forget to drink plenty of water. Water is essential for muscle growth, and it can help you stay hydrated during your workouts. So make sure you’re drinking at least eight glasses of water a day. </p>
