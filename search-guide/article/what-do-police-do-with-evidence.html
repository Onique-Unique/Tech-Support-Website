                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-2">How is evidence collected? </h2>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <p class="text"> Collection of evidence is an important part of any criminal investigation. Evidence can be anything from the victim's clothing to a murder weapon. The police must take care to collect all of the evidence from the scene of the crime, and to preserve it properly so that it can be used in court.</p>
                        <p class="text"> The police use a variety of methods to collect evidence. They may take photographs or videos of the crime scene, and they will often collect physical evidence such as fingerprints, blood samples, and hair samples. They may also collect evidence from electronic devices such as phones or computers. </p>
                        <p class="text"> Collection of evidence is a complex process, and the police must take care to ensure that they do not contaminate or lose any of the evidence. Any mistake in the collection process could lead to the evidence being thrown out of court. </p>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-3">What are the steps in the evidence process?</h2>
                    <p class="text">The steps in the evidence process can vary depending on the situation, but typically involve collecting, organizing, and analyzing evidence. </p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">First, law enforcement or other officials collect evidence at the scene of a crime or from other sources. </li>
                            <li class="text">They then must organize and label the evidence, making sure that everything is accounted for. </li>

                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">In order for the evidence to be useful in court, it must be analyzed to determine its relevance and authenticity. If the evidence is found to be credible, it can be used in court proceedings.</p>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-4">What happens to the evidence once it is collected? </h2>

                        <p class="text"> Once evidence is collected, it is sent to the lab for analysis. The lab will test the evidence for DNA, fingerprints, and other clues that can help identify the perpetrator. </p>
                        <p class="text"> The lab will also test the evidence for any drugs or weapons that may have been used in the crime. </p>

                    <p class="text">If you are a prosecutor, you want to make sure that you handle evidence properly. You don't want to risk losing a case because of mishandled evidence. Here are some tips that helps to make sure that evidence is handled properly:</p>

                            <li class="text">Make sure that evidence is properly marked and labeled.</li>
                            <li class="text">Make sure that evidence is secure and not accessible to anyone who is not authorized to have access to it.</li>
                            <li class="text">Make sure that evidence is transported in a secure manner.</li>

                            <li class="text">Make sure that evidence is processed and analyzed in a timely manner.</li>
                            <li class="text">Make sure evidence is not misplaced or missing pieces.</li>

                    <h2 class="title-secondary h2-highlight" id="review-6">What are the consequences of improper evidence handling? </h2>
                    <p class="text">Evidence handling is one of the most important aspects of any criminal investigation. If evidence is not handled properly, it can be compromised and may not be admissible in court. This can have serious consequences for the outcome of a case.</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">One of the most common ways evidence is mishandled is when it is not properly stored. This can include leaving evidence in the sun or in a hot car, or storing it in a damp or humid area. This can cause the evidence to degrade, which can make it unusable in court. </li>
                            <li class="text">Another common mistake is when investigators mishandle evidence while it is in their possession. This can include mishandling evidence during transport, or mishandling it during the investigation. This can damage the evidence, or contaminate it, which can also make it unusable in court. </li>
                            <li class="text">If evidence is mishandled, it may not be admissible in court, which can have a serious impact on the outcome of a case. Investigators should take care to handle evidence properly to ensure that it is not compromised. There can be some real serious consequences for both the prosecution and the defense as well when the evidence is mishandled.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text">For the prosecution, it can mean that they can't prove their case and the defendant may go free. </p>
                    <p class="text">For the defense, it can mean that they may not be able to present a strong defense and the defendant may be found guilty. </p>
                    <p class="text">Additionally, if the jury believes that the evidence has been mishandled, they may not trust the results of the trial.</p>

                    <p class="text">If you are involved in a criminal case, it is important to protect your rights. This may include hiring an attorney, filing motions, and attending court hearings. Here are some tips to help you protect your rights:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Hire an Attorney: It is important to have an attorney represent you in a criminal case. An attorney will be able to advise you of your rights, help you file motions, and represent you in court.</li>
                            <li class="text">File Motions: If you feel your rights have been violated, you can file a motion with the court. A motion can ask the court to take action or to stop something from happening.</li>

                            <li class="text">Finally, you should wait for the police to investigate the crime. Do not take any action yourself, such as confronting the person who you believe committed the crime. Let the police handle the investigation.</li>

                    <p class="text">Police departments must adhere to strict policies and regulations when it comes to the handling and disposal of evidence. Once evidence has been used in a court case and the trial has been completed, the department must take steps to ensure that the evidence is properly disposed of. This may include destroying the evidence.</p>
                    <p class="text">In some cases, evidence may be kept for a longer period of time. For example, DNA evidence or fingerprints may be kept for a longer period of time in order to be used in future cases. However, even in these cases, the department must take steps to ensure that the evidence is properly stored and protected. </p>
                    <p class="text">There are a few things that departments should keep in mind when disposing of evidence:</p>

                            <li class="text">First, the evidence should be properly documented and tracked. This will help to ensure that the department can account for all evidence that has been used in court cases. </li>
                            <li class="text">Second, the department should work with a qualified disposal company to ensure that the evidence is destroyed in a safe and effective manner. </li>
                            <li class="text">Finally, the department should create a policy for disposing of old evidence. This policy should outline the steps that the department will generally take to ensure that the evidence is properly destroyed, returned or disposed of.</li>

                    <p class="text">Police departments handle drug evidence in a variety of ways, depending on the department's policies and the type of drug involved. </p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <p class="text"> Generally, though, police will send drug evidence to a crime lab for analysis. If the drug is a controlled substance, the lab will determine the drug's chemical composition and release the results to the police department. If the drug is not a controlled substance, the lab will generally destroy the evidence.</p>
                        <p class="text"> Police departments have a variety of policies governing the handling of drug evidence. Some departments, for example, will destroy drug evidence that is not a controlled substance after a certain amount of time. Others departments will keep drug evidence indefinitely, regardless of whether it is a controlled substance. </p>
                        <p class="text text-alt"> When it comes to controlled substances, there are a few things that police departments typically do with the evidence. The department may choose to keep the drug evidence for use in criminal prosecutions, or they may choose to destroy the evidence. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="text">In some cases, the department may choose to send the drug evidence to the state crime lab for analysis.</p>
                    <p class="text">If you are arrested for a drug crime, the police will likely confiscate any drug evidence that is found on your person or in your home. </p>
                    <p class="text">It is important to speak with an attorney as soon as possible to learn about your rights and to determine what options are available to you.</p>
