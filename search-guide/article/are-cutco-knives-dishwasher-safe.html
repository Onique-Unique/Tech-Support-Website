                    <p class="text">When shopping for products for your home, it's important to know if they will hold up to the rigors of a dishwasher cycle. </p>
                    <p class="text"> Dishwasher-safe products are designed to withstand the high temperatures and detergents used in dishwashers, and can stand repeated exposure to these elements. </p>
                    <p class="text">Here are some considerations when determining whether a product is dishwasher safe:</p>
                    <div class="div-container">

                    </p>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="text">Hand Washing - This is the easiest, most accessible option. Make sure to use a non-abrasive sponge with a mild dish soap to gently scrub off any stuck-on residue, food particles or dirt. Always rinse your knives carefully with warm water after washing. Dry them with a non-abrasive cloth or towel.</li>
                            <li class="text">Boiling - Boil your knives in hot water for a few minutes to remove grease, debris and dirt. However, remember to do this in moderation too much boiling may damage the delicate handle material.</li>
                            <li class="text">Vinegar Soak - Soak your knives in a mild solution of vinegar and water for roughly 15 minutes. This can help loosen up stuck-on particles, and then you can simply scrub them off with a non-abrasive sponge.</li>
                            <li class="text">Vinegar/Baking Soda Paste - For tougher, stuck-on grime, use a paste made from equal parts vinegar and baking soda. Spread the paste on the blade and let sit for 30 minutes, then gently scrub off with a non-abrasive sponge.</li>
                            <li class="text">Ultrasonic Cleaner - This is the most professional option, but it can also be quite costly. An ultrasonic cleaner machines use high frequency sound waves to create powerful waves that can knock off particles and dirt with ease.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <p class="text">Handwashing is the most accessible, while an ultrasonic cleaner is the most efficient but most costly in terms of time and money.</p>
                    <p class="text">Hopefully one of these alternatives works for you and your Cutco Knife.</p>
